Objective 2 
•	Between 1993 and 2008, 5,740 operations were performed, and complete data were available for 5,735 (99.9%) patients. There were 5,774 surgical diagnoses, which were categorized as either acquired or congenital
•	There were 3,885 (67.3%) acquired conditions and 1,889 (32.7%) congenital conditions
•	Of the acquired conditions, there were 1,985 (34.4%) burns, either acute or sequelae such as contracture or open wounds, 514 (8.9%) keloids, 448 (7.8%) other injuries, 410 (7.1%) deep tissue infections, including osteomyelitis and cancrum oris (noma), and 343 (5.9%) tumors
•	Among the 1,889 congenital anomalies, 1,259 (21.8%) were cleft lip or cleft palate, and 354 (6.1%) were limb defects
•	Pediatric cases make up the majority of cases that presented for plastic surgery for both acquired conditions, notably burns, and congenital conditions
Objective 3 
•	Zambia has one plastic surgeon for the population of 12.6 million and no formal training program in plastic surgery.
•	There is a severe shortage of trained surgical clinicians, with an average of three surgeons produced each year. Specialty surgical care such as orthopedics, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and urology is markedly limited, and patients must travel to the capital of Lusaka for most specialty consultations and procedures.
•	The population of 12.6 million is low density with 64% living in rural areas, which makes development of facilities and infrastructure expensive on a per capita basis. Road infrastructure is poor, and Zambians have few options for transport over long distances.
•	Most  patients with burns and trauma presented after the acute phase with contractures and chronic wounds, pointing to missed opportunities to prevent disability and complications with proper acute and subacute care.
•	Delivery of plastic surgery to patients in rural areas is achieved through a mobile service supported by nongovernmental organization (NGO) funding and in cooperation with more than 30 district and mission hospitals who organize patients for two to three annual visits.

","""It might be  difficult
to distinguish between deep partial and full thickness burns, how-
ever, such information is of vital importance, as early skin grafting
of full thickness burns results in faster patient recovery and
reduces incidence and severity of contractures.""

""Referral to a better equipped
burn centre was often found to be problematic: in a burn facility
in a country like South Africa, which is officially not a low income
country according to the World Bank, patients were accepted for
transfer only in 3 out of 67 severe cases in need of more advanced
care.""

 ""Lack of resources was often reported as a limiting factor for (early) excision""
"" The fact that
eschar excision without skin grafting was performed in 6% of the
population shows a conservative approach, often because of lack
of resources""


",,,,,,,Commobidities,"""patients com-
monly arrive days or weeks after burn injuries occur, with heavily
infected wounds and in a poor overall condition [10,26]. These
patients are often malnourished, anaemic and are poor candidates
for immediate surgery. Malnourishment is a risk factor for post-
operative mortality. While associated with increased length of
stay, high infection rates and higher costs, delayed debridement
and grafting may still be the best option in this patient group""",,,,,,,"it might be necessary to take sufficient time to stabilize patients and prepare them for surgery in low resource settings.
An individual plan for staged excisions for a specific burn injury in a specific setting might be the most appropriate approach in low resource settings where resources and skills meet the minimal standards for basic surgical burn care. Specific body parts, in particular areas like joint surfaces that benefit from early interventions, starting with early excision may be advisable there. The
use of tourniquets and local anaesthesia with adrenaline where possible, renders this approach more suitable. The ISBI guidelines stress the importance of the combination of the dressing method and the timing of excision and grafting in full thickness burns. They recommend (staged) early excision and grafting combined with closed wound treatment when resources permit, except for hands, perineum and the face.",,,
