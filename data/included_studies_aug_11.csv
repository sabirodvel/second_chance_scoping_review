Surgical outcome and complications following cleft lip and palate repair in a teaching hospital in Nigeria,"Abdurrazaq, T. O.; Micheal, A. O.; Lanre, A. W.; Olugbenga, O. M.; Akin, L. L.","BACKGROUND: Measurement of treatment outcome is important in estimating the success of cleft management. The aim of this study was to assess the surgical outcome of cleft lip and palate surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The surgical outcome of 131 consecutive patients with cleft lip and palate surgeries between October 2008 and December 2010 were prospectively evaluated at least 4 weeks postoperatively. Data collected included information about the age, sex, type of cleft defects, and type of surgery performed as well as postoperative complications. For cleft lip repair, the Pennsylvania lip and nose (PLAN) score was used to assess the surgical outcome, while the integrity of the closure was used for cleft palate repair. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients had cleft lip repair and 64 had palate repair. Overall, 68.8% cases of cleft lip and palate repair had good outcomes; 67.9% of lip repairs had good lip and nose scores, while 70.2% of palatal repair had a good surgical outcome. Oro-fistula was observed in 29.8% of cleft palate repairs Inter-rater reliability coefficient was substantially significant. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that 25.7% of those treated were aged >1 year suggests a continued need to enlighten the public on the availability of cleft lip and palate expertise and treatment. Although an overall good treatment outcome was demonstrated in this study, the nasal score was poorer than the lip score. Complication rate of about 14% following surgical repair is consistent with previous reports in the literature.",2013,,Afr J Paediatr Surg,10,4,345-57,24469486,10.4103/0189-6725.125447,13671,#137,Abdurrazaq 2013,"",Cleft Palate
The economic burden associated with unmet surgical needs in Liberia: a retrospective macroeconomic analysis based on a nationwide enumeration of surgical procedures,"Adde, H. A.; Oghogho, M. D.; van Duinen, A. J.; Grimes, C. E.; Hampaye, T. C.; Quaife, M.; Bolkan, H. A.","OBJECTIVES: The economic consequences of untreated surgical disease are potentially large. The aim of this study was to estimate the economic burden associated with unmet surgical needs in Liberia. DESIGN: A nationwide enumeration of surgical procedures and providers was conducted in Liberia in 2018. We estimated the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved by operative activities and converted these into economic losses averted using gross national income per capita and value of a statistical life (VSL) approaches. The total, the met and the unmet needs for surgery were determined, and economic losses caused by unmet surgical needs were estimated. Finally, we valued the economic losses avoided by various surgical provider groups. RESULTS: A total of 55 890 DALYs were averted by surgical activities in 2018; these activities prevented an economic loss of between US$35 and US$141 million. About half of these values were generated by the non-specialist physician workforce. Furthermore, a non-specialist physician working a full-time position for 1 year prevented an economic loss of US$717 069 using the VSL approach, while a specialist resident and a certified specialist saved US$726 606 and US$698 877, respectively. The burden of unmet surgical need was associated with productivity losses of between US$388 million and US$1.6 billion; these losses equate to 11% and 46% of the annual gross domestic product for Liberia. CONCLUSION: The economic burden of untreated surgical disease is large in Liberia. There is a need to strengthen the surgical system to reduce ongoing economic losses; a framework where specialist and non-specialist physicians collaborate may result in better economic return than a narrower focus on training specialists alone.",2024,,BMJ Open,14,1,e076293,38191260,10.1136/bmjopen-2023-076293,13627,#212,Adde 2024,Rachel Wangi (2025-02-12 15:06:00)(Select): provides the cost averted by conducting surgery.

"Audit of oral and maxillofacial surgical conditions seen at Port Harcourt, Nigeria","Adebayo, E. T.; Ajike, S. O.; Abite, M. G.","Background: The worldwide pattern of oral and maxillofacial surgical conditions has been rarely reported despite its significance in head and neck medicine. The Niger Delta region comprises 9 of the 36 states in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. There are scanty reports on oral and maxillofacial surgical diseases from the region despite its 95% contribution to Nigeria's oil-revenue. Methods: This retrospective survey of oral/maxillofacial surgical cases seen at a referral center in Port Harcourt, a city in the Niger delta region of Nigeria. Results: Between 2000 and 2004, our center offered specialized maxillofacial surgical services to 86 patients coming from 5 states in the Niger delta region. These patients made up 20% of all patients seen at the department within the period. There were 110 indications for surgical interventions. Most were complaints of trauma (46.4%). The rest were tumors and allied lesions (39.0%) and cysts (12.7%). Ratio of male to female patients was 1.7:1 while patients were aged between 9 and 85years (mean 31.2years, standard deviation ±15.4). Most (n = 63, 73%) had surgical treatment while a significant proportion (19%) defaulted. Seventy -nine surgical procedures were performed (69 primary and 10 secondary). Primary procedures included maxillo-mandibular fixation (31.9%) and enucleation of tumor/cyst (17.4%). While our series of 86 cases over 4years appears low, there is likelihood that oral and maxillofacial surgical conditions are as common in the Niger Delta region as in other parts of Nigeria. There is scarcity of skilled manpower and equipments for the management of oral maxillofacial surgical conditions in the region. Health promotion activities are needed to improve awareness for early diagnosis of these conditions. Also, poverty alleviation measures need to be effective as defaults were often due to inability to pay for treatment. Conclusion: In many parts of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, oral and maxillofacial surgical diseases are not uncommon causes of morbidity. However, many parts of the region lack requisite manpower for prevention and curative health activities. Defaults from hospital treatment were due to preference for traditional (unorthodox) measures and financial inability. Poverty alleviation measures need to be stepped up while the state of medical infrastructure should be enhanced in the region.",2008,,Annals of African Medicine,7,1,29-34,,10.4103/1596-3519.55687,22172,#219,Adebayo 2008,"",Barriers to Care; Burden; Maxillo-facial surgery
Cancrum oris: Principles of management and reconstructive surgery,"Adekeye, E. O.; Ord, R. A.","A survey of 140 cases of cancrum oris in Nigerian Africans is presented. The salient clinical features, the problems of management and the modern approaches to the reconstruction of facial deformities seen in this disease are described. Mainly affected were children under the age of 10 years and the commonest involvement was the full thickness of the cheek. A high incidence of ankylosis was noted and the methods of anaesthesia and surgical correction of ankylosis are examined. The number of patients presenting for reconstruction of facial defects due to cancrum oris appears to be increasing.

Over 1000 patients reported and 801 received operations on a rotational basis within nine weeks. We studied 719 of these patients, ages between 4 months and 87 years, who had detailed follow-up records. There were 14 different procedures ranging from a hernia repair to the separation of syndactyly. Complications included postoperative pain, haematoma and late superficial wound infection.

"Locked intramedullary nailing of open fractures in resource-poor settings: a prospective observational study of challenges and functional outcomes in 101 fractures at Ogbomoso, Nigeria","Adesope Adesina, S.; Olusayo Amole, I.; Owolabi, J. I.; Oyewusi, O. O.; Goodness Adefokun, I.; Uwale Eyesan, S.","Background: Trauma is now one of the fastest growing epidemics globally but low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are more severely affected in terms of cost, disability and death. The high-energy trauma of road traffic accidents and violence often produces open fractures which can be difficult to manage in resource-poor settings. Adequate stabilization, such as provided by locked nails, has been found to ensure better outcome for open fractures. There is dearth of published studies on the use of locked intramedullary nail in the treatment of open fractures in Nigeria. Methods: This is a prospective observational study of all the 101 open fractures of the humerus, femur and tibia treated over a period of 92 months with Surgical Implant Generation Network (SIGN) nail. Fracture severity was classified according to the modified Gustilo-Anderson system. The intervals between fracture and antibiotics administration, débridement and definitive fixation, as well as surgery duration and method of fracture reduction were noted. Outcomes measured at follow-up included infection, ongoing radiographic healing, knee flexion/shoulder abduction beyond ninety degrees (KF/SA > 900), full weight bearing (FWB), painless squatting (PS&S)/shoulder abduction-external rotation (SAER). Results: Most of the patients fall between ages 20 and 49 years; 75.5% of them were males. There were more Gustilo-Anderson type IIIA fractures than other types but nine type IIIB tibia fractures were also nailed. The overall infection rate was 15%, contributed mostly by the type IIIB fractures. By the 12th post-operative week, at least 79% had ongoing radiographic healing and had achieved all of KF/SA > 900, FWB, and PS&S/SAER. Conclusion: The SIGN nail’s solid construct reduces the risk of infection and allows earlier use of the limb, making it particularly suitable in LIMCs where socioeconomic functioning often requires an unhindered use of the limbs.",2023,,BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,24,1,,,10.1186/s12891-023-06271-7,15826,#295,AdesopeAdesina 2023,"Lionel Bernard Dumont (2025-02-26 23:15:40)(Select): This is orthopedic surgrey but for some patient they performed skin grafting and muscle flap.

Once assessed fit for anaesthesia following initial resuscitation, wound débridement and irrigation were done in the operating room (OR). For patients who presented ≤ 8 hours’ post-injury, immediate primary wound closure was done if there was no soft tissue loss. Otherwise, a delayed closure with muscle flap and split-thickness skin graft was done at the time of definitive fracture fixation. Depending on the severity of their injuries, the patients either had further OR débridement or daily wound dressing changes by nurses on the wards.

Africa has unique and urgent barriers to cleft care: Lessons from practitioners at the pan-african congress on cleft lip and palate,"Adetayo, O.; Ford, R.; Martin, M.","Background: The goals of this study were to delineate the protocols employed for managing patients with cleft lip and palate deformities, delineate the challenges facing practitioners and patients, and to determine the patient and physician barriers to cleft care delivery in the region. Methods: Survey questionnaires were administered to practitioners attending the second Pan-African Congress on Cleft Lip and Palate (PACCLIP), which took place in Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa from February 4-7, 2007. The conference included 225 participants, representing 17 African countries. Results: Protocols for repair of cleft lip and palate deformities were varied, with Millard's and von Langenbeck's techniques being the preferred approach for the management of cleft lip and palate deformities, respectively. A large proportion of providers have limited access to core cleft care supporting teams, especially speech language pathologists, orthodontists, and audiologists. Several challenging barriers to cleft care were also identified at both the institutional and individual levels and are reported. Conclusion: Geographic separation in Africa presents a similar challenge due to isolationism as it does to surgeons in Europe. Specific to Africa are the increased barriers to care, and economic and financial hardship at various levels. A focus on funding, team building, infrastructural support, and patient education appear to be crucial in improving the care and lives of children with facial clefts in Africa. © Oluwaseun Adetayo et al.",2012,,Pan African Medical Journal,12,1,,,,21134,#306,Adetayo 2012,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-30 01:45:51)(Select): constraints and barriers to cleft care encountered by practitioners; ,Barriers to Care; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations
Management of complications of Mycobacterium ulcerans disease: A three-year review,"Adu, E. J. K.","Background: Infection with Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) causes extensive destruction of tissues with the formation of large ulcers on exposed parts of the body. Healing leads to extensive scarring and other complications which may impair function. Objective: To document the complications of MU disease and the reconstructive surgery performed to correct them. Study design: Prospective from January 2010 to December 2012. Setting: Ahafo Ano, Amansie West, Asunafo, and Upper Denkyira districts of Ghana. Methods: Patients with unhealed lesions after completing 8. weeks of rifampicin and streptomycin treatment, and patients with complications of MU disease were selected and prepared for surgical treatment. Results: 61 patients were treated successfully with rifampicin and streptomycin without complications. 65 patients presented with complications; they comprised 34 males and 31 females. Their ages ranged from 1. year 3. months to 80. years with mean age of 29.7 (S.D. 20.1).The types of lesions seen were ulcers (54), contractures (7), chronic osteomyelitis (one), subluxation of knee joint (one), salivary gland fistula (one) and Marjolin's ulcer (one). The lesions were distributed as follows: 69.2% on the lower, and 23.1% on the upper limbs, 6.2% on the head and neck and 1.5% on the trunk. Wound excision with or without skin grafting was done in 84.6% of patients, surgery for contractures in10.8%, and sequestrectomy, exploration and ligation of fistula, groin dissection and above knee amputation in 4.6%. Conclusion: Whilst ulcers, the commonest MU lesions, are being controlled with antibiotics, rare complications of the disease are also emerging. © 2013 Asian-African Society for Mycobacteriology.",2013,,International Journal of Mycobacteriology,2,4,206-210,,10.1016/j.ijmyco.2013.08.003,20786,#345,Adu 2013,Lionel Bernard Dumont (2025-02-16 21:03:32)(Select): Related to reconstructive sjurgery; Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-05 23:45:47)(Select): data on reconstructive surgeries performed on MU patients.; ,""
Mycobacterium ulcerans disease in the middle belt of Ghana: An eight-year review from six endemic districts,"Adu, E. J. K.; Ampadu, E.","Background: Mycobacterium ulcerans (MU) produces mycolactone toxin when infected with a plasmid. Toxin is cytotoxic and immunosuppressive, causing extensive destruction of tissues, leading to large ulcers on exposed parts of the body. Spontaneous healing by secondary intention leads to contractures, subluxation of joints, disuse atrophy, distal lymphedema and other complications. The disease is endemic in some communities within the middle belt of Ghana. Objective: To document the clinical and epidemiological features of MU disease in the middle belt of Ghana and the outcome of treatment. Patients and methods: Patients with lesions suspected to MU disease were screened by community workers. Lesions were confirmed by any of the following: direct smear examination, culture, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), or histopathology.Patients were treated with rifampicin (10. mg/kg orally) and streptomycin (15. mg/kg IM) combination for eight weeks. Patients selected for surgical treatment included cases where medical treatment had failed, cases where medical treatment is contraindicated, cases presenting late with complications and recurrent cases. Results: 258 patients were seen in the Ahafo Ano, Amansie Central, Amansie West, Asunafo, Asutifi, and Upper Denkyira districts of Ghana between 2005 and 2012. Their ages ranged from 1. year 3. months to 98. years, with a mean age of 29.8 (SD 20.4).The clinical forms of MU disease seen were: papule (0.5%), nodule (1.5%), chronic osteomyelitis (1.5%), contracture (1.5%), edematous lesion (3%), and ulcer (92%). Uncommon complications include subluxation of knee joint, salivary gland fistula and Marjolin's ulcer.The lesions were distributed as follows: head and neck (6.8%), upper limb (20.3%), trunk (1.7%), and lower limb (71.2%).

Delayed access to essential surgical care in Uganda: A tertiary multi-center study,"Adupa, E.; Kanyike, A. M.; Mwebembezi, J.; Nteranya, D. S.; Ndibalema, M.; Matovu, D.; Niwenyesiga, V.; Arinda, S.; Agaba, K.","Background: Surgery has been largely neglected within global public health despite growing evidence that the overall burden of disease requiring surgical intervention is rapidly growing and affordable access to surgical care can avert many deaths and disabilities. This study assessed the factors influencing delayed access to essential surgical care in Uganda. Methods: A descriptive multi-center cross-sectional survey was carried out in three hospitals designated for major surgeries in Uganda from December 2019 to December 2021 across three regions of the country in a prospective manner. Patients admitted to the hospitals that required surgical intervention were included. Bivariate analysis using the chi-square test or Fischers’ exact test and multivariable logistic regression models to adjust for confounders were carried out. Findings: A total of 635 patients participated in the study of which the majority were males (n = 399, 63%) from the Northern region (n = 347, 54.7%.). Most patients and sought surgical help immediately (n = 406, 63.9%) and were operated on time (n = 402, 63.3%), however only 23.3% (n = 148) were able to reach the hospital for care on time. Caretakers’ hesitancy on the surgical procedure (aOR: 2.41 95% CI: 1.07 – 5.43; p = 0.035), hospital inaccessibility (aOR: 5.35 95% CI: 1.82 – 5.75; p = 0.002), and delayed surgical procedure performance (aOR: 6.37 95% CI: 2.64 – 5.34; p<0.001) contributed to surgical delays among other factors.

"Modernized standards in burns management: A comparative study in Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana","Agbenorku, P.","Background: Management of burns patients before May 2009 was very difficult at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH). Aim: To compile burns patients' information in the new Burns Intensive Care Unit (BICU), analyze it and draw comparisons to information from the old BICU at KATH. Methods: This retrospective study involves data from May 2007 to April 2009 (Group 1-old BICU) and May 2009 to April 2011 (Group 2-new BICU). The parameters of burn patients recorded included: record of admission, gender, age, aetiology of injury, Total Burns Surface Area (TBSA), the patients' treatment regime and record of discharge/death. This information was analyzed with SPSS version 18.0. Results: The total number of patients in the study was 511; Group 1 constituted 47.36% (n = 242) patients; males (n = 307, 61%) outnumbering females (n = 204, 39%). The overall mean, median and interquartile range (IQR) ages of the patients were 12.4 ± 2; 9.5 and 18.0 years respectively. The main aetiology of burns in Group 1 was flame burns (n = 115, 47.5%) and for Group 2 was scald (n = 151, 56.1%). The median TBSA recorded for Groups 1 and 2 were 32% and 41% respectively. A mortality rate of 19.1% (n = 46) and 12.7% (n = 34) were recorded for Groups 1 and 2 respectively which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). We found no differences for age and TBSA (P = 0.7168 and P = 0.8020 respectively). A Chi Square analysis for gender and aetiology of burn revealed no significant difference between Groups 1 and 2. A risk factor analysis for mortality within the Groups (using multiple regression analysis) identified only aetiology of burn in Group 1 to be a factor (P = 0.044). Conclusion: This comparative study reveals that a significant difference in mortality was recorded for both groups. The mortality difference does not appear to be due to socio-demographic features. This study may demonstrate that modernized and advanced equipment with the adequate personnel play an essential role in burn management in low income countries such as Ghana. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

Methods: Data were collected from clinical records from the Burns Intensive Care Unit and the Casualty Unit of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana and from the various disaster sites and the Ghana Police Service. Results: A total of 212 were injured from four burn disasters; 37 (17%) died on the spot; 175 (83%) reported to the Casualty Unit out of which 46 (26%) were admitted. The victims admitted had mean age 24.6 years with male to female ratio 2.3:1; 25 (54%) of the admitted victims died. The average burned surface area of the admitted victims was 63%, with a mean survival rate of 46%. Statistical analysis for mortality when the surface area of the burn was >70% was 0.0005 (P-value).

"A new era in the management of burns trauma in kumasi, ghana","Agbenorku, P.; Akpaloo, J.; Yalley, D.; Appiah, A.","The aim of the study was to investigate the factors affecting the outcome of treatment of burns patients admitted to the Burns Intensive Care Unit (BICU) of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Information on patients admitted to the BICU from February 2001 to January 2006 was recorded. Parameters recorded included: admission record and demographics, causes of the injury, burned surface area, laboratory investigations, treatment regime, and record of discharge/death. The data were analysed with SPSS version 12.0 and Spearman's rank correlation. A total of 826 patients were recorded; males (n = 492, 60%) outnumbered females (n= 334, 40%). The mean age was 10.5 ± 5 yr, the majority (n = 441, 53%) in the range 0-10 yr. Flame burns (n = 587, 71%), scalds (n = 209, 25%), and chemicals (n = 19, 2%) were the three significant causes of burn injuries. The mean range of the total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 11-20%; 94% (n = 775) had up to 60% TBSA; 64% (n = 527) had only wound dressings for treatment; 21% (n = 174) had early excision with skin grafting, while 15% (n = 125) had delayed excision with skin grafting. The majority (n = 563, 68%) of the patients stayed for less than 10 days after admission. The mortality rate fell over the years, decreasing drastically between 2001 (20.4%) and 2002 (8.6%) and remaining at single digit level in 2003 (7.6%), 2004 (7.9%), and 2005 (7.4 %).

A.","Objective. We conducted a prospective study to identify the direct hospitalization cost of managing major acute burns in Lagos, Nigeria, and to determine the factors that influence the cost. Method. All consecutive and consenting patients seen and managed for major burns at the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Igbobi, Lagos, between 1 June 2007 and 31 May 2008 were recruited for the study. A special form designed for the study was used to collect the necessary data. Results. Fifty-two patients were seen during the study period (27 males and 25 females). The ages ranged from 2 months to 69 yr with a mean of 25.4 ± 17.1 yr. The length of hospital stay ranged from 0.3-12 months (mean, 3.2 ± 3.1 months). The average daily cost of treating a patient was ₦ (naira) 8,855 (₦1000 = €4.44) and the average overall cost was ₦209,303.70, with the costs of wound dressings, hospital admission, and surgery constituting respectively 29.5%, 25.7%, and 19.1% of the total amount spent. Conclusion. The length of hospital stay was prolonged in many patients and management methods should be reviewed to reduce this. The cost of managing burns is prohibitive for an average Nigerian.

Spectrum of paediatric surgical cases in a private mission teaching hospital in Nigeria,"Ajao, A. E.; Adeniran, J. O.","Introduction: Establishing the nature of conditions requiring surgery among children in a particular location may be crucial for policy formulation and implementation as regards paediatric surgery. Objective: This study aimed to describe the pattern and outcome of paediatric surgical cases operated upon in a newly established paediatric surgical unit in Nigeria. Subjects and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of all subjects that were operated upon by the paediatric surgery unit over a 28-month period. Data obtained included age, sex, diagnosis, timing of surgery, post-treatment complications and outcome. Diagnoses were categorised based on the International Classification of Diseases 11th revision for morbidity and mortality statistics. Data analysis was done using Stata version 12. Results: A total of 377 procedures were performed on 336 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 2.1:1. The median age at surgery was 36 months. Disorders of the digestive system (184, 48.8%) and developmental anomalies (119, 31.6%) accounted for majority of the cases, with inguinal hernias and hydrocoeles accounting for 17.0% of all cases. Thirty-six per cent of the procedures were emergent ones, and the overall complication rate was 23.6% (89/377). The unplanned re-operation rate was 7.4% (25/336) and mortality rate was 5.1% (17/336). Typhoid ileal perforation was responsible for 4 (23.5%) of the deaths.

Method: A three-year retrospective study (2008-2010) involving 79 adult patients with clefts. Results: Seventy nine (14.4%) of 550 patients with orofacial clefts seen and treated within a three-year period were adults with age range of 17 to 81 years; mean 31.45 ± 13.09. Majority were between 20 and 39 years. There were 54 (68.4%) males and 25 (31.6%) females, with the male:female ratio of 2.2:1. Analysis of the cleft types/site revealed 35 (44.3%) lip alone, 22 (27.8%) lip and alveolus, 7 (8.9%) lip and palate and 15 (19%) palate alone. Seven (8.9%) of these patients had other relatives with clefts. Sources of information were friends and relatives; 33 (41.8%), radio; 18 (22.8%), charity organization/NGO; 13 (16.5%), hospitals/physicians; 5 (6.3%), and others; 10 (12.7%). 57 patients with lip clefts had surgery under local anesthesia while the remaining 22 patients were done under general anesthesia. All clefts of the lip were repaired using the Millard advancement rotational flap for complete cleft, simple straight line closure for incomplete and double layer closure for the palate. Conclusion: The incidence of adult patients with orofacial cleft is not rare in our community, probably due to limited access to specialized health care facilities, poverty and ignorance.

"Surgical procedures for children in the public healthcare sector: A nationwide, facility-based study in Uganda","Ajiko, M. M.; Kressner, J.; Matovu, A.; Nordin, P.; Wladis, A.; Löfgren, J.","Objective This study investigated the surgical services for children at the highest levels of the public healthcare sector in Uganda. The aim was to determine volumes and types of procedure performed and the patients and the human resource involved. Design The study was a facility-based, record review. Setting The study was carried out at the National Referral Hospital, all 14 regional referral hospitals and 14 general hospitals in Uganda, representing the highest levels of hospital in the public healthcare sector. Participants The subjects were children <18 years who underwent major surgery in the study hospitals during 2013 and 2014. Results The study hospitals contribute with an average annual rate of paediatric surgery at 22.0 per 100 000 paediatric population. This is a fraction of the estimated need. Most of the procedures were performed for congenital anomalies (n=3111, 39.4%), inflammation and infection (n=2264, 28.7%) and trauma (n=1210, 15.3%). Specialist surgeons performed 60.3% (n=4758) of the procedures, and anaesthesia was administered by specialist physician anaesthetists in 11.6% (n=917) of the cases. Conclusions A variety of paediatric surgical procedures are performed in a relatively decentralised system throughout Uganda. Task shifting and task sharing of surgery and anaesthesia are widespread: a large proportion of surgical procedures was carried out by non-specialist physicians, with anaesthesia mostly delivered by non-physician anaesthetists.

Prevalence of Paediatric Surgical Conditions in Eastern Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Ajiko, M. M.; Weidman, V.; Nordin, P.; Wladis, A.; Löfgren, J.","BACKGROUND: The role of surgery in global health has gained greater attention in recent years. Approximately 1.8 billion children below 15 years live in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Many surgical conditions affect children. Therefore, paediatric surgery requires specific emphasis. Left unattended, the consequences can be dire. Despite this, there is a paucity of data regarding prevalence of surgical conditions in children in LMIC. The present objective was to investigate the prevalence of paediatric surgical conditions in children in a defined geographical area in Eastern Uganda. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site located in Eastern Uganda. Through a two-stage, cluster-based sampling process, 490 households from 49 villages were randomly selected, generating a study population of 1581 children. The children's caregivers were interviewed, and the children were physically examined by two medical doctors to identify any surgical conditions. RESULTS: The interview was performed with 1581 children, and 1054 were physically examined. Among these, the overall prevalence of any surgical condition was 16.0 per cent (n = 169). Of these, 39 per cent had an unmet surgical need (66 of 169). This is equivalent to a 6.3 per cent prevalence of current unmet surgical need. The most common groups of surgical condition were congenital anomalies and trauma-related conditions. CONCLUSION: Surgical conditions in children are common in eastern Uganda. The unmet need for surgery is high. With a growing population, the need for paediatric surgical capacity will increase even further.

Disparities in Access to Trauma Care in Sub-Saharan Africa: a Narrative Review,"Alayande, B.; Chu, K. M.; Jumbam, D. T.; Kimto, O. E.; Danladi, G. M.; Niyukuri, A.; Anderson, G. A.; El-Gabri, D.; Miranda, E.; Taye, M.; Tertong, N.; Yempabe, T.; Ntirenganya, F.; Byiringiro, J. C.; Sule, A. Z.; Kobusingye, O. C.; Bekele, A.; Riviello, R. R.","Purpose of Review Sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse context with a large burden of injury and trauma-related deaths. Relative to high-income contexts, most of the region is less mature in prehospital and facility-based trauma care, education and training, and trauma care quality assurance. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes rising inequalities, both within and between countries as a deterrent to growth and development. While disparities in access to trauma care between the region and HICs are more commonly described, internal disparities are equally concerning. We performed a narrative review of internal disparities in trauma care access using a previously described conceptual model. Recent Findings A broad PubMed and EMBASE search from 2010 to 2021 restricted to 48 sub-Saharan African countries was performed. Records focused on disparities in access to trauma care were identified and mapped to de Jager's four component framework. Search findings, input from contextual experts, comparisons based on other related research, and disaggregation of data helped inform the narrative. Only 21 studies were identified by formal search, with most focused on urban versus rural disparities in geographical access to trauma care. An additional 6 records were identified through citation searches and experts. Disparity in access to trauma care providers, detection of indications for trauma surgery, progression to trauma surgery, and quality care provision were thematically analyzed. No specific data on disparities in access to injury care for all four domains was available for more than half of the countries. From available data, socioeconomic status, geographical location, insurance, gender, and age were recognized disparity domains. South Africa has the most mature trauma systems. Across the region, high quality trauma care access is skewed towards the urban, insured, higher socioeconomic class adult. District hospitals are more poorly equipped and manned, and dedicated trauma centers, blood banks, and intensive care facilities are largely located within cities and in southern Africa. The largest geographical gaps in trauma care are presumably in central Africa, francophone West Africa, and conflict regions of East Africa. Disparities in trauma training opportunities, public-private disparities in provider availability, injury care provider migration, and several other factors contribute to this inequity. National trauma registries will play a role in internal inequity monitoring, and deliberate development implementation of National Surgical, Obstetrics, and Anesthesia plans will help address disparities. Human, systemic, and historical factors supporting these disparities including implicit and explicit bias must be clearly identified and addressed. Systems approaches, strategic trauma policy frameworks, and global and regional coalitions, as modelled by the Global Alliance for Care of the Injured and the Bellagio group, are key. Inequity in access can be reduced by prehospital initiatives, as used in Ghana, and community-based insurance, as modelled by Rwanda. Summary Sub-Saharan African countries have underdeveloped trauma systems. Consistent in the narrative is the rural-urban disparity in trauma care access and the disadvantage of the poor. Further research is needed in view of data disparity. Recognition of these disparities should drive creative equitable solutions and focused interventions, partnerships, accompaniment, and action.",2022,,Curr.

Paediatric burn injuries in Sub Saharan Africa-an overview,"Albertyn, R.; Bickler, S. W.; Rode, H.","Paediatric burn injuries in Sub Saharan Africa are common and often lead to devastating consequences. Unfortunately relevant and accurate data regarding these injuries is sketchy and incomplete. This paper reviews the available information on the epidemiology of paediatric burns in Africa, associated health problems and contributing environmental factors responsible for these burns. The current status of burn care, the lack of infrastructure, and traditional methods of treatment, further contribute to the unsatisfactory status of overall burn management, prevention, and rehabilitation of burn survivors. A strategy for improving burn care in Africa has been formulated. The management of childhood burns will only be successful if educational, social, fiscal and infrastructure standards are improved. Traditional beliefs and methods cannot be discarded as they play an important role in the management of these children. It is furthermore essential that local and central government organisations support these initiatives. Clearly, the children of Africa deserve better burn care. © 2005.",2006,,Burns,32,5,605-612,,10.1016/j.burns.2005.12.004,22380,#582,Albertyn 2006,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-19 04:03:39)(Select): general overview on burn care capacity in SSA; barriers to care; Rachel Wangi (2025-02-18 21:35:48)(Select): Burden, surgical capacity, barriers to care; ",Burden; Burns; Children / Pediatric Population
Delays to Surgery and Coronal Malalignment Are Associated with Reoperation after Open Tibia Fractures in Tanzania,"Albright, P. D.; Ali, S. H.; Jackson, H.; Haonga, B. T.; Eliezer, E. N.; Morshed, S.; Shearer, D. W.","Background Treatment of diaphyseal open tibia fractures often results in reoperation and impaired quality of life. Few studies, particularly in resource-limited settings, have described factors associated with outcomes after these fractures. Questions/purposes (1) Which patient demographic, perioperative, and treatment characteristics are associated with an increased risk of reoperation after treatment of open tibia fractures with intramedullary nailing or an external fixation device in Tanzania? (2) Which patient demographic, perioperative, and treatment characteristics are associated with worse 1-year quality of life after treatment of open tibia fractures with intramedullary nailing or an external fixation device in Tanzania? Methods A prospective study was completed in parallel to a similarly conducted RCT at a tertiary referral center in Tanzania that enrolled adult patients with diaphyseal open tibia fractures from December 2015 to March 2017. Patients were treated with either a statically locked intramedullary nail or external fixator and examined at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. The primary outcome, reoperation, was any deep infection or nonunion treated with a secondary intervention. The secondary outcome was the 1-year EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) index score. There were 394 patients screened and ultimately, 267 patients enrolled in the study (240 from the primary RCT and 27 followed for the purposes of this study). Of these, 90% (240 of 267) completed 1-year follow-up and were included in the final analysis. This group comprised 110 patients who underwent IMN and 130 who had external fixation; follow-up was similar between study groups. Patients were an average of 33 years old and were primarily males who sustained road traffic injuries resulting in AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) classification type A or B fractures. There were 51 reoperations. For the purposes of analysis, all patients were pooled to identify all other factors, in addition to treatment type, associated with increased risk of reoperation and 1-year quality of life. An exploratory bivariable analysis identifying various factors associated with reoperation risk and EQ-5D was subsequently included in a multivariate modeling procedure to control for confounding of effect on our primary outcome. Multivariable modeling was performed using standard hierarchical modeling simplification procedures with log-likelihood ratios. Alpha levels were set to 0.05. Results After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as gender, smoking status, mechanism of injury, and treatment type, the following factors were independently associated with reoperation: Time from hospital presentation to surgery more than 24 hours (odds ratio 7.7 [95% confidence interval 2.1 to 27.8; p = 0.002), AO/OTA fracture classification Type 42C fracture (OR 4.2 [95% CI 1.2 to 14.0]; p = 0.02), OTA-Open Fracture Classification muscle loss (OR 7.5 [95% CI 1.3 to 42.2]; p = 0.02), and varus coronal angle on an immediate postoperative AP radiograph (OR 4.8 [95% CI 1.2 to 14.0]; p = 0.002). After again controlling for confounding variables such as gender, smoking status, mechanism of injury, and treatment type factors independently associated with worse 1-year EQ-5D scores included: Wound length >= 10 cm (ss = [change in EQ-5D score] -0.081 [95% CI -0.139 to -0.023]; p = 0.006), OTA-Open Fracture Classification muscle loss (ss = -0.133 [95% CI -0.215 to -0.051]; p = 0.002), and OTA-Open Fracture Classification bone loss (ss = -0.111 [95% CI -0.208 to -0. 013]; p = 0.03). We observed a modest, but independent association between reoperation and worse 1-year EQ-5D scores (ss = -0.113 [95% CI -0.150 to -0.077]; p < 0.001). Conclusions We found two potentially modifiable factors associated with the risk of reoperation: reducing time to surgical treatment and avoiding varus coronal angulation during definitive stabilization. Hospitals may be able to minimize time to surgery, and thus, reoperation, by increasing the number of available operative personnel and space and emphasizing the importance of open tibia fractures as an injury requiring emergent orthopaedic management. Given the lack of fluoroscopy in the study setting and similar settings, surgeons should emphasize appropriate fracture alignment, even into slight valgus, to avoid varus angulation and subsequent reoperation risk.",2020,,Clin.

'We are all serving the same Ugandans': A nationwide mixed-methods evaluation of private sector surgical capacity in Uganda,"Albutt, K.; Drevin, G.; Yorlets, R. R.; Svensson, E.; Namanya, D. B.; Shrime, M. G.; Kayima, P.","Introduction Half of all Ugandans (49%) turn to the private or private-not-for-profit (PNFP) sectors when faced with illness, yet little is known about the capacity of these sectors to deliver surgical services. We partnered with the Ministry of Health to conduct a nationwide mixed-methods evaluation of private and PNFP surgical capacity in Uganda. Methods A standardized validated facility assessment tool was utilized to assess facility infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, information management, and financing at a randomized nationally representative sample of 16 private and PNFP hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to qualitatively explore facilitating factors and barriers to surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia (SOA) care. Hospitals walk-throughs and retrospective reviews of operative logbooks were completed. Results Hospitals had a median of 177 beds and two operating rooms. Ten hospitals (62.5%) were able to perform all Bellwether procedures (cesarean section, laparotomy and open fracture treatment). Thirty-day surgical volume averaged 102 cases per facility. While most hospitals had electricity, oxygen, running water, and necessary equipment, many reported pervasive shortages of blood, surgical consumables, and anesthetic drugs. Several themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) geographic distance and limited transportation options delay reaching care; (2) workforce shortages impede the delivery of surgical care; (3) emergency and obstetric volume overwhelm the surgical system; (4) medical and non-medical costs delay seeking, reaching, and receiving care; and (5) there is poor coordination of care with insufficient support systems. Conclusion As in Uganda's public sector, barriers to surgery in private and PNFP hospitals in Uganda are cross-cutting and closely tied to resource availability. Critical policy and programmatic developments are essential to build and strengthen Ugandan surgical capacity across all sectors.",2019,,PLoS ONE,14,10,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0224215,18343,#586,Albutt 2019,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-21 06:31:36)(Select): surgical capacity; barriers to surgical care

"Management Outcome of Burn Injury and Associated Factors among Hospitalized Children at Ayder Referral Hospital, Tigray, Ethiopia","Alemayehu, S.; Afera, B.; Kidanu, K.; Belete, T.","Background. Burn injuries are a global public health problem, accounting for an estimated 265,000 deaths. Globally, over half of the disability-adjusted life years lost from fire-related burns which occurred between the ages of 0 and 14 years. The rate of child deaths from burns is currently over 7 times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. In Ethiopia, burn was the second leading cause of death among children from the unintentional injuries. So far, no research had been conducted in terms of assessing the outcome of burn injury in children in Ethiopia and particularly in Tigray region. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of burn injury and associated factors among hospitalized children of under 18 years at Ayder Referral Hospital in Mekelle, Ethiopia. Method. A retrospective document review was used to assess the outcome of burn injury and associated factors in Ayder Referral Hospital. A total of 382 hospitalized children's chart from 2011 to 2015 were reviewed using a structured check list. To select the patients' chart, a simple random sampling technique was used and a sampling frame was prepared based on a registration book. Data was entered, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Result. Almost 70% of the burns were caused by scald, and 45.3% of the burns were confined to the upper extremities. Eighty-two percent of the patients were discharged without complication.

"Assessment of emergency and essential surgical service in primary hospitals of South Gondar zone, Amhara region, Ethiopia, 2019","Alemayehu, T. Y.; Boled, A. T.; Taye, M. G.; Kibret, S.; Habtie, M. F.","Introduction: Surgical service at the first level referral hospitals are an important aspect of comprehensive health care. Surgical disease has been estimated to constitute 11% of the total global burden of disease, of which a substantial fraction unfortunately remains unmet in resource limited area. Surgical volume is large and continues to grow in all economic environments, yet many low-income countries fail to achieve basic levels of surgical service. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of emergency and essential surgical service in primary hospital facilities of south Gondar zone in Amhara regional state. Design: A cross sectional survey was employed in seven primary hospitals of south Gondar zone. Material: The WHO tool for situational analysis to assess emergency and essential surgical care was employed to capture a health facility's capacity to perform basic surgical (including obstetrics and trauma) and anesthesia interventions by investigating four categories of data: infrastructure, human resources, interventions available and equipment. The tool queried the availability of eight types of care providers, 35 surgical interventions and 67 items of equipment. Result: Of the 35 basic interventions listed in the tool, 51.4% basic interventions including caesarean section were available at all facilities. Averaging of 51 beds per facility was reported. The mean distance travelled prior to admission was 42 km. A total of 170 healthcare providers were reported in the seven facilities. This survey found that essential equipment was not consistently available at all of the facilities. Conclusion: Discrepancies in infrastructure, human resources, service provision, and essential equipment and supplies demonstrate the significant gaps in capacity of hospitals to deliver emergency and essential surgical care and effectively addressing the increasing surgical burden of disease and injury in south Gondar zone primary hospitals.

Potential economic benefit of cleft lip and palate repair in sub-Saharan Africa,"Alkire, B.; Hughes, C. D.; Nash, K.; Vincent, J. R.; Meara, J. G.","BACKGROUND: Acceptance of basic surgical care as an essential element of any properly functioning health system is growing. To justify investment in surgical interventions, donors require estimates of the economic benefit of treating surgical disease. The present study aimed to establish a methodology for valuing the potential economic benefit of surgical intervention using cleft lip and palate (CLP) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a model. METHODS: Economic modeling of cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP) in SSA was performed with retrospective demographic and economic data from 2008. The total number of Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) secondary to CLP in 2008 was calculated from accepted clefting incidence rates and disability weights taken from the Global Burden of Disease Project. DALYs were then converted to monetary terms ($US), using both a human capital approach and Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) approach. RESULTS: With the human capital approach, the potential economic benefit if all incident cases of CLP in SSA in 2008 were repaired at birth ranged from $252 million to $441 million. With VSL, the potential economic benefit of the same CLP repair would range from $5.4 billion to $9.7 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Cleft lip and cleft palate can have a substantial impact on the economic health of countries in the developing world. Further studies should be directed at quantifying the economic benefit of surgical interventions and quantifying their costs with an economically sound approach.",2011,,World J Surg,35,6,1194-201,21431442,10.1007/s00268-011-1055-1,13516,#662,Alkire 2011,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-11 05:25:47)(Select): DALYs re: CLP; Rachel Wangi (2025-02-11 00:38:37)(Select): discusses the cost of Reconstructive surgeries; ,Cleft Palate

This study aims to determine the effect of training community members as volunteers for or in the detection and referral of people who have Buruli ulcer to the hospital. Methods: The following study is a before and after study in the BU-endemic Local Government Areas (LGA) of Ebonyi State. A cluster random sampling technique was used to select 90 volunteers from three LGAs (30 from each LGA). In each LGA, the volunteers underwent a one-day training and six months field work to identify all those who have any form of ulcer on any part of their bodies. A short questionnaire was used to capture socio-demographic characteristics of the patient, site of the ulcer, duration of the ulcer, initial appearance of the ulcer, referral to hospital, result of laboratory investigation, and treatment received. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Microsoft Windows version 20 software. The Z test statistic was used to compare the number of referred BU patients before and after the intervention by LGA. The Chi square test was used to examine the association between the dependent and independent variables. Results: The mean age of volunteers was 39 ± 9.5 while mean age of the patients was 42.3 ± 17.1. Most of the ulcers were on the legs (79.4%) and lasted 1–5 years (65.6%). There was a significant increase in the proportion of BU suspects identified by the community volunteers in all 3 LGAs (Afikpo north (p = < 0.001), Abakaliki (p = 0.02), Ikwo (p = 0.001). The duration of the ulcer was associated with the detection and referral of the patients with higher levels of detection and referral among those whose ulcer had lasted 1–5 years in two of the LGAs (P < 0.001). Conclusion: We recommend that program managers and stakeholders integrate and scale up the services of trained community health volunteers for the rapid detection of Buruli ulcer cases in rural endemic communities.

S.","PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to estimate the burden of musculoskeletal disease among children treated in Kumi District, Uganda, to inform training, capacity-building efforts, and resource allocation. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by reviewing the musculoskeletal (MSK) clinic and community outreach logs for children (age < 18 years) seen at Kumi Hospital in Kumi, Uganda, between January 2013 and December 2015. For each patient, we recorded the age, sex, diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. RESULTS: Of the 4852 children, the most common diagnoses were gluteal and quadriceps contractures (29.4% (95% CI 28.1-30.7%), 96% of which were gluteal fibrosis), post-injection paralysis (12.7% (95% CI 11.8-13.6%)), infection (10.5% (95% CI 9.7-11.4%)), trauma (6.9% (95% CI 6.2-7.6%)), cerebral palsy (6.9% (95% CI 6.2-7.7%)), and clubfoot (4.3% (95% CI 3.8-4.9%)). Gluteal fibrosis, musculoskeletal infections, and angular knee deformities create a large surgical burden with 88.1%, 59.1%, and 54.1% of patients seen with these diagnoses referred for surgery, respectively. Post-injection paralysis, clubfoot, and cerebral palsy were treated non-operatively in over 75% of cases. CONCLUSION: While population-based estimates of disease burden and resource utilization are needed, this data offers insight into burden of musculoskeletal disease for this region of Sub-Saharan Africa. We estimate that 50% of the surgical conditions could be prevented with policy changes and education regarding injection practices and early care for traumatic injuries, clubfeet, and infection.

I.; Ibrahim, A.","INTRODUCTION: Trauma in developing countries has been on the increase, a situation perpetuated by rising road traffic collisions, terrorism and firearms proliferation. Some of the victims of trauma are left with life threatening conditions requiring urgent surgical intervention and/or intensive care. The objectives of this study were to determine the pattern of major trauma needing intensive care in the region, and to determine the outcome of major trauma admitted to intensive care unit. METHODS: A six-year retrospective cohort study of trauma patients needing intensive care, set in the Intensive Care Unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, North-West Nigeria. Subjects were major trauma patients admitted into the intensive care unit of the institution, identified via an admission register kept in the unit. The main outcomes measured were length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Trauma admissions represented 25.1% of the all intensive care admissions. Severe traumatic brain injury accounted for 32.1% of the trauma admissions, while burns accounted for 23.2%. Of the injuries, 15.5% were sustained in bomb blasts, and 8.3% were firearm injuries. The majority of the patients stayed for no more than seven days from admission. Burns patients had the worst outcomes, with 82.1% mortality. CONCLUSION: Major trauma contributes significantly to local intensive care admissions, with terrorism- related trauma now an emerging challenging cause of major trauma in our region.

This study was aimed at filling the gap in the real-time data about burns in Togo by assessing sociodemographic, clinical and outcome characteristics, causes and severity of burns of hospitalized patients for prevention programs. Methodology: This retrospective study analysed the medical folders of patients admitted to the ICU department of Sylvanus Olympio Teaching Hospital (SOTH) in Lomé for an acute burn injury during 7 years (January 2007–December 2013). We collected sociodemographic parameters, causes, and mechanisms of burns; the time between burns injury and admission to the Surgical Emergency Department (SED), pre-hospital care, pre-existing medical conditions, and treatments. Burned total body surface area (TBSA), anatomical sites and depth of burns, treatment and outcomes were assessed by EPI INFO 3.5.3 (ATLANTA CDC 2003). Results: Burns represented 2.1% of all admissions to the SED. Of the 1,843 burn patients, 497 (26.9%) were admitted to the ICU department, and 1,346 (73%) were treated as outpatients. The analysis included the complete folders of 211 patients. The patients’ mean age was 14.9 years (4 months-94 years). The male to female ratio was 1.67. Children numbered 129 (61.1%) and adults 82 (38.9%).

PATTERNS AND OUTCOMES OF PEDIATRIC BURN INJURIES IN A TERTIARY HOSPITAL's BURN UNIT,"Asefa, L.; Abebe, M. W.; Negussie, A. G.","Introduction: Burn is skin and tissue damage caused by various agents such as fire, scalds, electricity, chemicals, or radiation injuries. Globally, burn injuries pose a substantial public health challenge, with a high risk of mortality and morbidity, accounting for over 310,000 annual deaths. Nearly 75 % of burns in young children result from scald burns and infants have the highest mortality rates. Factors such as large surface area of burn, inhalational injury, poverty, and the presence of sepsis contribute significantly to mortality and morbidity in burns. Objective: To assess the pattern of presentation of pediatric burn injuries and their management outcomes. Methods: A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were extracted from patient charts, cleaned, coded, checked for completeness, and entered into SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for data analysis, and graphical presentations were utilized to present the result findings. Results: Among the 218 paediatric burn patients admitted to the Addis Ababa Burn, Emergency and Trauma Hospital's burn unit, 71.1 % had sustained scald burns due to hot water splashes, while 20.2 % of the patients were admitted due to flame burns. Superficial partial thickness burns occurred in 53.6 % of the patients, with the upper extremity and trunk being the most commonly affected sites. Approximately 38.2 % of the patients developed acute complications, with sepsis of the wound focus being the most common. Chronic complications occurred in 30.7 % of patients, primarily in the form of post-burn contractures. A mortality rate of 3.2 % was observed during the admission period with 2.3 % of deaths occurring in children under 5 years and those with major burns.

The orthopaedic needs of children in Rwanda: results from a national survey and orthopaedic service implications,"Atijosan, O.; Simms, V.; Kuper, H.; Rischewski, D.; Lavy, C.","BACKGROUND: When faced with developing orthopaedic services for children in Sub-Saharan Africa, there is little objective evidence-based data on the magnitude and type of services needed. Rwanda is a small country that is in the process of developing orthopaedic and rehabilitation services, and its Ministry of Health supported a survey that would provide information necessary for planning such services. METHODS: A national survey of musculoskeletal impairment (MSI) prevalence was undertaken. Of a population of 8.4 million, 8368 people were enumerated. Four thousand one hundred thirty-four were aged 16 years or less. Cases who failed a screening test for MSI were examined, allocated a diagnostic category, and assessed as to treatment needed. RESULTS: Of 4134 people aged 16 years or less who were enumerated, 3526 (85%) were screened and 91 had MSI, giving a prevalence of MSI among children of 2.58% (95% confidence interval; 2.06-3.10). Twenty-three percent of MSIs were a result of congenital deformity, 14% neurologic conditions, 12% trauma, 3% infection, and 46% other acquired pathology. Of the MSIs, 56.7% were mild, 37.8% moderate, and 5.6% severe.

Mortality Pattern in Surgical Wards of a University Teaching Hospital in Southwest Nigeria: A Review,"Ayoade, B. A.; Thanni, L. O.; Shonoiki-Oladipupo, O.","Background There are many reports from different parts of the world addressing different aspects of surgical mortality. There are few reports from our country, however, and most of them have dealt with mortality in the emergency room. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of mortality associated with surgical care and the trends in prevalence of surgical mortality. We used our results as benchmarks to identify areas of improvement. Methods The records of all patients who died during admission for surgical care in Olabisi Onabanjo Teaching Hospital Sagamu between January 2006 and December 2010 were studied retrospectively. Relevant data were extracted, including demographics, surgical diagnosis, co-morbid conditions, length of hospital stay, surgical procedure performed, outcome of treatment, and date of death. Results were analyzed with Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 15. Results The total admission in the surgical wards for 2005-2010 was 5,444, with a total of 2,217 surgical operations carried out during the same period. There were 277 (5.09 %) deaths (165 male and 112 female patients). Of 277 deaths, only 170 case notes (61 %) were available for review. Primary causes of death were classified as cancer (50 deaths, 29.4 %), trauma (66, 38.8 %), infection/inflammatory (16, 9.4 %), and other (38, 22.4 %). Surgical operations were performed in 60 (35.3 %) of the patients who died. No surgery was done in 110 (64.7 %) of those who died. Conclusions The pattern of surgical mortality is not directly related to surgical procedures as most of the deaths occurred in the nonoperative care group.

Presentation of Pediatric Unintentional Injuries at Rural Hospitals in Rwanda: A Retrospective Study,"Bagahirwa, I.; Mukeshimana, M.; Cherian, T.; Nkurunziza, T.; El-Khatib, Z.; Byiringiro, J. C.; Ng'ang'a, L.; Rusingiza, E.; Riviello, R.; Ndayisaba, G. F.; Hedt-Gauthier, B. L.","BACKGROUND: Injuries are a leading cause of mortality among children globally, with children in low- and middle-income countries more likely to die if injured compared to children in high-income countries. Timely and high-quality care are essential to reduce injury-related morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: This study describes patterns, management, and outcomes of children 0-15 years presenting with unintentional injuries at three district hospitals in rural Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 2017. METHODS: Using a retrospective cross-sectional study design, we assessed the demographic and clinical characteristics, care provided, and outcomes of the children using data extracted from patient medical charts. We describe the patient population using frequencies and proportions as well as median and interquartile ranges. FINDINGS: Of the 449 injured children who sought care at the three rural district hospitals, 66.2% (n = 297) were boys. The main causes of injury were falls (n = 261, 58.1%), burns (n = 101, 22.5%), and road traffic injuries (n = 67, 14.9%). Burns were the most common injury among children aged 0-5 years while falls were the leading injury type among the 5-15 years age group. Vital signs were inconsistently completed ranging between 23.8-89.1% of vital sign items. Of the injured children, 37.0% (n = 166) received surgery at the district hospital, general practitioners performed 80.9% (n = 114) of surgeries, 87.4% (n = 145) of operated patients received no anesthesia, and 69.3% (n = 311) were admitted to the district hospital, while 2.7% (n = 12) were transferred to tertiary facilities for higher-level care. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of child injuries-namely falls, burns, and road traffic accidents-is similar to what has been reported in other sub-Saharan African countries. However, more needs to be done to improve the completion and documentation of vital signs and increase availability of surgical specialists. Finally, targeted strategies to prevent burns and motorcycle-related injuries are recommended prevention interventions for this rural population.",2020,,Ann Glob Health,86,1,116,32983912,10.5334/aogh.2711,13365,#1082,Bagahirwa 2020,"",Burden; Burns; Injuries; Road Traffic Accidents

Recurrence of post burn contractures of the elbow and shoulder joints: experience from a Ugandan hospital,"Balumuka, D. D.; Galiwango, G. W.; Alenyo, R.","BACKGROUND: Recurrence of post-burn contractures, following inadequate management of post-burn contractures (PBC), is under reported. It is associated with multiple operations and an increased cost to patients and their families. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of recurrence of PBC of the shoulder and the elbow joint three months after surgical intervention and the associated risk- factors. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted at CoRSU hospital from March 2012 to November 2014. All patients with PBC of the elbow and/or shoulder joint who consented to be in the study and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Data was collected using a pretested, coded questionnaire. A goniometer was used to measure the active range of motion of the involved joint. The measurements were recorded in degrees. The data was analysed with STATA version 12.1. RESULTS: 58 patients were enrolled consecutively in the study. There were 36 females and 22 males, with a female to male ratio of 1.6:1. The age range was 0.75-45 years, with a median age of 5 years. The average age at the time of injury was 3.4 years. The most common cause of initial burn injury was scalding. The average number of joints involved per patient was two. There was a high incidence of recurrence of PBC (52 %) among the participants. The shoulder had the highest frequency of recurrence at 67 %. The elbow joint had a frequency of recurrence of 27 %. All participants with both elbow and shoulder joint involvement had PBC recur. The risk factors for recurrence were flame burn (p = 0.007), duration of PBC of more than 1 year (p = 0.018), and incomplete release of the contracture (p = 0.002). The presence of keloids, hypertrophic scars, ulcers and the occurrence of complications at the contracture site were not associated with recurrence of PBC. CONCLUSION: Recurrence of PBC of the elbow and shoulder joint is a common problem. The risk factors should be kept in mind during management of PBC to reduce the recurrence rate.",2015,,BMC surgery,15,,103,,10.1186/s12893-015-0089-y,20169,#1135,Balumuka 2015,"",Burden; Burns

This study is the first to explore burn scars in rural communities in Mozambique. This work also validated an innovate burn assessment tool, the Morphological African Scar Contractures Classification (MASCC), used to determine surgical need. METHODS: Using a stratified, population-weighted survey, the team interviewed randomly selected households from September 2012 to June 2013. Three rural districts (Chókwè, Nhamatanda, and Ribáuè) were selected to represent the southern, central and northern regions of the country. Injuries were recorded, documented with photographs, and approach to care was gathered. A panel of residents and surgeons reviewed the burn scar images using both the Vancouver Scar Scale and the MASCC, a validated visual scale that categorizes patients into four categories corresponding to levels of surgical intervention. RESULTS: Of the 6104 survey participants, 6% (n = 370) reported one or more burn injuries. Burn injuries were more common in females (57%) and most often occurred on the extremities. Individuals less than 25 years old had a significantly higher odds of reporting a burn scar compared to people older than 45 years. Based on the MASCC, 12% (n = 42) would benefit from surgery to treat contractures. CONCLUSION: Untreated burn injuries are prevalent in rural Mozambique.

Barriers and prospects for skin grafting in burn treatment across African countries,"Bbaale, D.; Mohr, C.; Lindert, J.; Allorto, N.; Mabanza, T.; Katabogama, J. B.; Chamania, S.; Elrod, R.; Boettcher, M.; Elrod, J.","INTRODUCTION: The current standard management of full-thickness or deep dermal burns is early tangential excision and skin grafting. A conservative approach to deep burns without the option of skin grafting results in delayed wound healing, possibly leading to wound infection and is associated with hypertrophic scarring and increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the management and availability to perform skin grafting for burns on the African continent. It also sought to identify challenges and perceived improvements. METHODS: A web-based, structured, closed-formatted, multinational survey was designed to gather information on the current state and availability of skin grafting of burn wounds on the African continent. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions, available in English and French. It was reviewed within the GAP-Burn collaboration network and sent to 271 health care professionals who had participated in a previous study and had initially been recruited by means of the snowball system. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed 84 times (response rate: 31.0%), of which 3 were excluded. Responses originated from 22 African countries. The majority 71 (87.7%) resulted from countries with a low Human Development Index (HDI), 7 (8.6%) from medium HDI countries. Split thickness skin grafting (STSG) is performed in 51 (63.0%) centers. The majority considers STSG to reduce length of stay (72.8%) and improve scarring (54.3%), yet some indicated that STSG is associated with increased risk of donor site infection (8.6%) and severe bleeding (7.4%). Factors preventing increased grafting included lack of equipment and training. CONCLUSION: Skin grafting is not performed in a significant number of hospitals treating burns. The majority of the staff believe that more skin grafting would lead to a better outcome. Advocacy and improved infrastructure, human resources coupled with introduction to well-structured health coverage for all in African countries could help to better access and affordability in burn care.",2024,,Burns,50,5,1150-1159,38490835,10.1016/j.burns.2024.02.012,13370,#1259,Bbaale 2024,"",Barriers to Care
Rural and urban differences in treatment status among children with surgical conditions in Uganda,"Bearden, A.; Fuller, A. T.; Butler, E. K.; Tran, T.; Makumbi, F.; Luboga, S.; Muhumuza, C.; Ssennono, V.; Galukande, M.; Haglund, M.; Smith, E. R.","BACKGROUND: In low and middle-income countries, approximately 85% of children have a surgically treatable condition before the age of 15. Within these countries, the burden of pediatric surgical conditions falls heaviest on those in rural areas. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the relationship between rurality, surgical condition and treatment status among a cohort of Ugandan children. METHODS: We identified 2176 children from 2315 households throughout Uganda using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey. Children were randomly selected and were included in the study if they were 18 years of age or younger and had a surgical condition. Location of residence, surgical condition, and treatment status was compared among children. RESULTS: Of the 305 children identified with surgical conditions, 81.9% lived in rural areas. The most prevalent causes of surgical conditions reported among rural and urban children were masses (24.0% and 25.5%, respectively), followed by wounds due to injury (19.6% and 16.4%, respectively). Among children with untreated surgical conditions, 79.1% reside in rural areas while 20.9% reside in urban areas. Among children with untreated surgical conditions, the leading reason for not seeking surgical care among children living in both rural and urban areas was a lack of money (40.6% and 31.4%, respectively), and the leading reason for not receiving care in both rural and urban settings was a lack of money (48.0% and 42.8%, respectively).

Surgical burn care in sub-saharan africa: A systematic review,"Beijneveld, J. A.; Botman, M.; Hendriks, T. C. C.; Negenborn, V. L.; Schoonmade, L. J.; Mackie, D. P.; Van Zuijlen, P. P. M.","Burn injuries are still one of the most common and devastating global health problems worldwide. The vast majority of burns occur in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A certain standard of surgical and anesthesia care is essential to minimize morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to obtain baseline information on surgical burn care in SSA and to determine how this can be improved. A systematic review (PRISMA) was conducted. Data were extracted regarding patient characteristics, surgical care, dressing techniques and outcome. Forty-seven articles from 12 different countries were included. The mean TBSA was 18.2%. Overall mortality was 12.6%. Of the included patients, 47% underwent an operation. Seventeen studies (36% of included studies) reported on the number of patients with deep burn wounds in their population. In this group, 90% was grafted (reported in 17 studies), 25% was done early (<10 days), and 75% late. In this group, the escharotomy rate was 11% (only shown in 3 studies), the amputation rate was 3% (in 6 studies), and development of contractures 8% (reported in 6 studies). Research on surgical burn care in SSA is scarce and a wide range of surgical treatment strategies was found. We were unable to conclude which treatment protocol, early or delayed excision, was most effective. Future studies should ensure uniform data collection to enable comparison between treatment strategies. To improve burn care, the recently published ISBI guidelines for burns provide a practical tool and national and regional treatment protocols, including training in burn surgery, should be developed. We recommend a new review of surgical care in 5 years to evaluate the effects of the ISBI guidelines.",2018,,Wound Repair and Regeneration,26,2,A18,,,19104,#1290,Beijneveld 2018,"",Burden; Burns

A.; Oketade, I.; Ighile, N.; Udoh, N.; Enebong, D.","Introduction: Orofacial cleft has a worldwide distribution but it is peculiar in the developing countries due to poor healthcare facility with resultant high incidence of unoperated adult cleft. Various model of surgical mission by foreign experts had existed to combat this menace. The indigenous rotatory model by Cleft & facial deformity foundation is hereby presented. Methods: Carrying out an outreach programme in a rural area begins with the identification of a hospital with optimum facility, followed by effective awareness campaign, then a pre- surgical meeting with the hospital management. Personnel, equipment and materials were mobilised to the site while surgery usually lasted one week. Results: Seventeen outreach programmes were carried out in 10 different hospitals from March 2011 to June 2017. There were 546 orofacial cleft patients, 280 (51.3%) males and 266 (48.7%) females. The age ranged between 1 week to 70years with a mean age ± (SD) of 9.3±11.5. Four hundred and forty eight (82.1%) of the cleft patients were operated. Three hundred and twenty two (59.0%) patients were treated under general anaesthesia while 126 (23.1%) were treated under local anaesthesia. Eight surgeons and 4 anaesthetics were trained during the study period with several local practitioners benefitting from exposure to standard practice. Standard techniques were employed for cheiloplasty and palatoplasty. Minor complications were recorded with one mortality. Conclusion: This model is an effective and efficient way of reaching out to the poor patients with orofacial cleft.

Intangible cost was assessed using Likert scale analysis. The overall household cost, average cost of various injuries and intangible costs were determined. RESULTS: The total annual household cost of injuries to patients who attended KBTH was US$11,327,461.96, of which 82% was the direct cost. The average household cost of injuries was US$ 1276.15. All injuries recorded some level of high intangible cost but was exceptional for burns. CONCLUSION: Injured patients incur high direct treatment cost in all aetiology, with generally high intangible cost as well. It is therefore imperative that injury prevention strategies be prioritized in national health policies, while broader discussions continue on sustainable health financing of injury management.",2020,,Afr J Emerg Med,10,Suppl 1,S44-s49,33318901,10.1016/j.afjem.2020.04.004,15132,#1457,Blankson 2020,"",""

M.","This study investigates patients' access to surgical care for burns in a low- and middle-income setting by studying timeliness, surgical capacity, and affordability. A survey was conducted in a regional referral hospital in Manyara, Tanzania. In total, 67 patients were included. To obtain information on burn victims in need of surgical care, irrespective of time lapsed from the burn injury, both patients with burn wounds and patients with contractures were included. Information provided by patients and/or caregivers was supplemented with data from patient files and interviews with hospital administration and physicians. In the burn wound group, 50% reached a facility within 24 hours after the injury. Referrals from other health facilities to the regional referral hospital were made within 3 weeks for 74% in this group. Of contracture patients, 74% had sought healthcare after the acute burn injury. Of the same group, only 4% had been treated with skin grafts beforehand, and 70% never received surgical care or a referral. Together, both groups indicated that lack of trust, surgical capacity, and referral timeliness were important factors negatively affecting patient access to surgical care. Accounting for hospital fees indicated patients routinely exceeded the catastrophic expenditure threshold. It was determined that healthcare for burn victims is without financial risk protection. We recommend strengthening burn care and reconstructive surgical programs in similar settings, using a more comprehensive health systems approach to identify and address both medical and socioeconomic factors that determine patient mortality and disability.",2022,,Journal of Burn Care and Research,43,3,657-664,,10.1093/jbcr/irab191,16817,#1540,Botman 2022,"",Access to Healthcare; Burns
Pediatric emergency and essential surgical care in Zambian hospitals: A nationwide study,"Bowman, K. G.; Jovic, G.; Rangel, S.; Berry, W. R.; Gawande, A. A.","Purpose: Pediatric surgical care in developing countries is not well studied. We sought to identify the range of pediatric surgery available, the barriers to provision, and level of safety of surgery performed for the entire pediatric population in Zambia. Methods: In cooperation with the Ministry of Health, we validated and adapted a World Health Organization instrument. During onsite visits, the availability of 32 emergency and essential surgical procedures relevant to children was surveyed. The availability of basic World Health Organization surgical safety criteria was determined. Results: A single interviewer visited 103 (95%) of 108 surgical hospitals in Zambia and carried out 495 interviews. An average of 68% of the 32 emergency and essential surgical procedures was available (range 32%-100%). Lack of surgical skill was the primary reason for referral in 72% of procedure types, compared with 24%, 2% and 3% due to lack of equipment, supplies and anesthesia skills, respectively (p < 0.001). Minimum pediatric surgical safety criteria were met by 14% of hospitals. Conclusion: The primary limitation to providing pediatric surgical care in Zambia is lack of surgical skills. Minimum safety standards were met by 14% of hospitals. Efforts to improve pediatric surgery should prioritize teaching surgical skills to expand access and providing safety training, equipment and supplies to increase safety. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

O. S.; Beynon, F.","Introduction: Trauma accounts for a significant proportion of the global burden of disease, with highest mortality rates seen in Africa. This epidemic is predicted to increase with urbanisation and an aim of the Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce deaths and trauma caused by road accidents. Data available on urban trauma in Sierra Leone is limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of trauma and injury related presentations to the emergency centre (EC) of Connaught Hospital, the principal adult tertiary referral centre in Freetown, Sierra Leone between January and March 2016. Patient demographics are described with mechanism of injury. Additional data on length of stay and surgical procedures were recorded for admissions to the trauma ward. Results: During the 3-month period, a total of 340 patients with injury presented to the EC, accounting for 11.6% of total attendances and 68% of adult surgical admissions. The majority were male (66%) and mean age was 26 years (IQR 15–40). The proportion of trauma presentations were higher in the evening and at weekends and 41% of patients were triaged as emergency or very urgent cases. Road traffic accidents were the most frequent cause of injury (55%) followed by falls (17%) and assaults (14%). Burns were more common in children. Head and lower limbs were the most commonly injured body parts and a minority of patients underwent surgical procedures. Median length of stay for adult patients was 4.5 days (IQR 2–11) and 7 days (IQR 4–14) for children.

The Met Needs for Pediatric Surgical Conditions in Sierra Leone: Estimating the Gap,"Burgos, C. M.; Bolkan, H. A.; Bash-Taqi, D.; Hagander, L.; Von Schreeb, J.","Background In low-and middle-income countries, there is a gap between the need for surgery and its equitable provision, and a lack of proxy indicators to estimate this gap. Sierra Leone is a West African country with close to three million children. It is unknown to what extent the surgical needs of these children are met. Aim To describe a nationwide provision of pediatric surgical procedures and to assess pediatric hernia repair as a proxy indicator for the shortage of surgical care in the pediatric population in Sierra Leone. Methods We analyzed results from a nationwide facility survey in Sierra Leone that collected data on surgical procedures from operation and anesthesia logbooks in all facilities performing surgery. We included data on all patients under the age of 16 years undergoing surgery. Primary outcomes were rate and volume of surgical procedures. We calculated the expected number of inguinal hernia in children and estimated the unmet need for hernia repair. Results In 2012, a total of 2381 pediatric surgical procedures were performed in Sierra Leone. The rate of pediatric surgical procedures was 84 per 100,000 children 0-15 years of age. The most common pediatric surgical procedure was hernia repair (18%), corresponding to a rate of 16 per 100,000 children 0-15 years of age. The estimated unmet need for inguinal hernia repair was 88%.

In Africa, orofacial clefts are underascertained, with little or no surveillance system in most parts for clefts and other birth defects. A Nigerian craniofacial anomalies study, NigeriaCRAN, was established in 2006 to support cleft research specifically for epidemiological studies, treatment outcomes, and studies into etiology and prevention. We pooled data from seven of the largest Smile Train treatment centers in the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. Data from September 2006 to June 2011 were analyzed and clefts compared between sides and genders using the Fisher exact test. A total of 2197 cases were identified during the study period, with an estimated prevalence rate of 0.5 per 1000. Of the total number of orofacial clefts, 54.4% occur in males and 45.6% in females. There was a significant difference (P = .0001) between unilateral left clefts and unilateral right clefts, and there was a significant difference (P = .0001) between bilateral clefts and clefts on either the left or right side. A significant gender difference (P = .03) was also observed for cleft palate, with more females than males. A total of 103 (4.7%) associated anomalies were identified. There were nine syndromic cleft cases, and 10.4% of the total number of individuals with clefts have an affected relative. The significant difference between unilateral clefts and the gender differences in the proportion of cleft palate only are consistent with the literature.

Many children never seek medical care, thus the true prevalence of surgical conditions in children in Uganda is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of surgical conditions in children in Uganda. METHODS: Using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey, we enumerated 4248 individuals in 2315 households in 105 randomly selected clusters throughout Uganda. Children aged 0-18 were included if randomly selected from the household; for those who could not answer for themselves, parents served as surrogates. RESULTS: Of 2176 children surveyed, 160 (7.4 %) reported a currently untreated surgical condition. Lifetime prevalence of surgical conditions was 14.0 % (305/2176). The predominant cause of surgical conditions was trauma (48.4 %), followed by wounds (19.7 %), acquired deformities (16.2 %), and burns (12.5 %). Of 90 pediatric household deaths, 31.1 % were associated with a surgically treatable proximate cause of death (28/90 deaths).

Globally, 11% of all disability-adjusted life-years lost result from conditions requiring surgery; however, little is known about country-specific burden. We piloted a household-based survey in a periurban district of Uganda to estimate the prevalence of surgical conditions and to identify logistical challenges. METHODS: Our sample comprised 57 households in 5 enumeration areas in the Wakiso District, in central Uganda. Our survey tool was the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical need. A household representative completed demographic and household death information, and 2 randomly selected household members completed questions on surgical conditions. RESULTS: Of 96 participants, 6 (6.3%; 95% CI, 2.3-13.1) had an existing, untreated surgical condition. The lifetime prevalence of surgical conditions was 26% (25/96). The most common barrier to access to care was lack of financial resources. Of the 3 deaths reported, 2 were associated with surgery. The mean household interview time was 36 minutes. The greatest challenge was efficient coordination with local team members and government officials. CONCLUSION: In this setting, the current prevalence of surgical conditions was nearly 1 in 10 persons, and lifetime occurrence was high, at 1 in 4 persons.

Epidemiology of pediatric surgical needs in low-income countries,"Butler, E. K.; Tran, T. M.; Nagarajan, N.; Canner, J.; Fuller, A. T.; Kushner, A.; Haglund, M. M.; Smith, E. R.","OBJECTIVE: According to recent estimates, at least 11% of the total global burden of disease is attributable to surgically-treatable diseases. In children, the burden is even more striking with up to 85% of children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) having a surgically-treatable condition by age 15. Using population data from four countries, we estimated pediatric surgical needs amongst children residing in LMICs. METHODS: A cluster randomized cross-sectional countrywide household survey (Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need) was done in four countries (Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Nepal and Uganda) and included demographics, a verbal head to toe examination, and questions on access to care. Global estimates regarding surgical need among children were derived from combined data, accounting for country-level clustering. RESULTS: A total of 13,806 participants were surveyed and 6,361 (46.1%) were children (0-18 years of age) with median age of 8 (Interquartile range [IQR]: 4-13) years. Overall, 19% (1,181/6,361) of children had a surgical need and 62% (738/1,181) of these children had at least one unmet need. Based on these estimates, the number of children living with a surgical need in these four LMICs is estimated at 3.7 million (95% CI: 3.4, 4.0 million). The highest percentage of unmet surgical conditions included head, face, and neck conditions, followed by conditions in the extremities. Over a third of the untreated conditions were masses while the overwhelming majority of treated conditions in all countries were wounds or burns. CONCLUSION: Surgery has been elevated as an ""indivisible, indispensable part of health care"" in LMICs and the newly formed 2015 Sustainable Development Goals are noted as unachievable without the provision of surgical care. Given the large burden of pediatric surgical conditions in LMICs, scale-up of services for children is an essential component to improve pediatric health in LMICs.",2017,,PLoS One,12,3,e0170968,28257418,10.1371/journal.pone.0170968,13304,#1701,Butler 2017,"",Barriers to Care; Surgical Capacity
Orofacial Clefts at Bugando Medical Centre: Associated Factors and Postsurgical Complications,"Buyu, Y.; Manyama, M.; Chandika, A.; Gilyoma, J.","Objective: To determine factors associated with orofacial clefts and postsurgical complications of cleft lip and palate repair surgeries in northwestern Tanzania. Methods: This was a cohort study involving patients with orofacial clefts. Associated factors (family history of orofacial clefts, maternal use of alcohol and cigarette smoking during pregnancy) were obtained through interviews with accompanying parents. Antenatal cards were used to obtain maternal age at birth and birth weight. Results: Ninety-four patients with different orofacial clefts were seen. Among them, 46.8% (44/94), 13.8% (13/94), and 39.4% (37/94) had cleft lip, cleft palate, and cleft lip and palate, respectively. About 15% of orofacial cleft cases had a positive family history of orofacial clefts. Among these, 7.4% had an affected relative on the maternal side, 4.3% had an affected relative on the paternal side, and 3.2% had an affected sibling. This difference was statistically significant (chi-square = 27.7, p < .001). Orofacial cleft was significantly associated with order of birth (chi-square = 21.0, p < .001). Postoperative complications observed included palatal fistula and philtrum dehiscence. Conclusion: Family history of orofacial clefts and order of birth were significantly associated with orofacial clefts in northwestern Tanzania. These factors have been associated with risk of orofacial clefts elsewhere and suggest a hereditary role in the etiology of orofacial cleft.

Given an annual worldwide incidence of almost 11 million new individuals affected per year, major burn injuries have a higher annual incidence than HIV and tuberculosis combined. METHODS: A survey instrument was adapted for use as an international assessment tool and then used to measure the availability of personnel, materials, equipment, medicines, and facility resources in nine Rwandan hospitals, including three referral centers. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of surveyed hospitals had a dedicated acute-care burn ward, while two-thirds had intensive care options. Relevant wound-care supplies were widely available, but gaps in the availability of critical pieces of equipment such as monitors, ventilators, infusion pumps, electrocautery, and dermatomes were discovered in many of the surveyed institutions, including referral hospitals. Early excision and grafting were not performed in any of the hospitals and there were no physicians with specialty training in burn care. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas all surveyed hospitals were theoretically equipped to handle the initial resuscitation of burn patients, none of the hospitals were capable of delivering comprehensive care due to gaps in equipment, personnel, protocols, and training.

Data on patient’s characteristics, circumstances of injury, injury characteristics, treatment offered, outcome variables, length of hospital stay and mortality were collected using a questionnaire.Results: A total of 342 street children (M: F = 6.8: 1) representing 11.5% of all paediatric injury patients were studied. The modal age group was 11-15 years (median = 12 years) accounting for 53.2% (n=182) of the patients. Assault was the most frequent (73.7%) cause of injury. More than three quarter of injuries occurred along the street. Most of patients (59.1%) presented late (>24 hours) after injury. Blunt injuries were the most common (76.0%) mechanism of injuries. Musculoskeletal (30.8%) and head (25.3%) were the most frequent body regions affected. Soft tissue injuries were the most common type of injuries affecting 322 (94.2%) cases. Majority of patients (96.5%) underwent surgical treatment of which wound debridement (97.6%) was the most common surgical procedure performed. Complication rate was 39.5%. The median hospital stay was 6 days. Mortality rate was 13.5% and it was significantly associated with injury-arrival time (OR =2.4, 95%CI (1.3-5.6), p = 0.002), severe injury (Kampala Trauma Score <6) (OR = 3.6, 95%CI (2.5-7.9), p = 0.001), severe head injuries (OR= 5.1, 95%CI (4.6 – 8.2), p =0.012) and surgical site infection.Conclusion: Trauma among street children is an emerging but neglected epidemic in Tanzania and contributes significantly to high morbidity and mortality. Assault was the most frequent cause of injury. Urgent preventive measures targeting at reducing the occurrence of assault is necessary to reduce the incidence of trauma among street children in this region.",2016,,Tanzania Journal of Health Research,18,3,,,10.4314/thrb.v18i2.x,20005,#1820,Chalya 2016,"",Access to Healthcare; Burden; Burns; Fractures; Trauma

M.","Major limb amputation is reported to be a major but preventable public health problem that is associated with profound economic, social and psychological effects on the patient and family especially in developing countries where the prosthetic services are poor. The purpose of this study was to outline the patterns, indications and short term complications of major limb amputations and to compare our experience with that of other published data. This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre between March 2008 and February 2010. All patients who underwent major limb amputation were, after informed consent for the study, enrolled into the study. Data were collected using a pre-tested, coded questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 computer software. A total of 162 patients were entered into the study. Their ages ranged between 2-78 years (mean 28.30 ± 13.72 days). Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 2:1. The majority of patients (76.5%) had primary or no formal education. One hundred and twelve (69.1%) patients were unemployed. The most common indication for major limb amputation was diabetic foot complications in 41.9%, followed by trauma in 38.4% and vascular disease in 8.6% respectively. Lower limbs were involved in 86.4% of cases and upper limbs in 13.6% of cases giving a lower limb to upper limb ratio of 6.4:1 Below knee amputation was the most common procedure performed in 46.3%. There was no bilateral limb amputation. The most common additional procedures performed were wound debridement, secondary suture and skin grafting in 42.3%, 34.5% and 23.2% respectively. Two-stage operation was required in 45.4% of patients. Revision amputation rate was 29.6%. Post-operative complication rate was 33.3% and surgical site infection was the most common complication accounting for 21.0%. The mean length of hospital stay was 22.4 days and mortality rate was 16.7%.

Although many individual case reports exist, no comprehensive evaluation of Marjolin's ulcer patients has been conducted in our setting. This study was conducted to describe the clinicopathological presentation and treatment outcome of this condition in our local setting and to identify predictors of outcome. Methods: This was a retrospective study of histologically confirmed cases of Marjolin's ulcer seen at Bugando Medical Centre over a period of 10-years between January 2001 and December 2010. Data were retrieved from patients' files and analyzed using SPSS computer software version 15.0 Results: A total of 56 patients were studied. Male to female ratio was 2.1:1. Burn scars (89.3%) were the most common causative lesions of Marjolin's ulcer. The mean latent period between original injury and diagnosis of Marjolin's ulcer was 11.34 +/- 6.14 years. Only 12.0% of the reported cases were grafted at the time of injury (P<0.00). Most patients (48.2%) presented between one and five years of onset of illness. The lower limb (42.9%) was the most frequent site for Marjolin's ulcers. The median tumor size at presentation was 8 cm and the vast majority of patients (85.7%) presented with large tumors of [greater than or equal to] 5 cm in diameter. Lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis was recorded in 32.1% of cases and distant metastasis accounted for 26.9% of cases. Squamous cell carcinoma (91.1%) was the most common histopathological type. Wide local excision was the most common surgical procedure performed in 80.8% of cases. Post-operative complication rate was 32.1% of which surgical site infection was the most common complication in 38.9% of patients. Local recurrence was noted in 33.3% of cases who were treated surgically. The mean length of hospital stay for in-patients was 7.9 +/- 2.3 days. Mortality rate was 7.1%. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, stage and grade of the tumor and presence of local recurrence were the main predictors of death (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Marjolin's ulcers are not rare in our environment and commonly occur in burn scars that were not skin grafted and were left to heal secondarily. A high index of suspicion is required in the management of chronic non-healing ulcers and all suspected lesions should be biopsed.

Surgical Care in Liberia and Implications for Capacity Building,"Chao, T. E.; Patel, P. B.; Kikubaire, M.; Niescierenko, M.; Hagander, L.; Meara, J. G.","BACKGROUND: Situational needs of health care facilities inform the optimal allocation of resources and quality improvement efforts. This study examines surgical care delivery metrics at a tertiary care institution in Liberia. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed operative and ward logbooks from January 1 to December 31, 2012. Data parameters included patients' age, diagnosis, procedure, mortality, and perioperative provider information. RESULTS: In 2012, 1,036 operations were performed. The breakdown of adult surgical cases reveals 452 (45.1%) general surgery operations, 192 (18.5%) orthopedic operations, and 180 (17.4%) ophthalmic operations. Other significant case volume included urologic 53 (5.1%), ENT 36 (3.5%), neurosurgical 31 (3.0%), vascular 24 (2.3%), and plastic 14 (1.4%) operations. Pediatric patients accounted for 24.5% (243) of surgical cases, and 9% of pediatric surgical cases were for hydrocephalus. General, spinal, and total intravenous anesthesia was provided by non-physician personnel, except when surgeons provided their own anesthesia. Ward logs documented 7.4% mortality among all patients admitted to the surgical ward, most of which occurred after exploratory laparotomy (44%), in burn (14%) patients, and in patients with head/neck emergencies (12%). CONCLUSIONS: This operative log review can be used to identify surgical practice patterns, needs, and deficits in order to inform the growth of surgical capacity at Liberia's only tertiary medical institution. Using this data to identify critical areas of high-yield operations (e.g., for pediatric hydrocephalus), or excessively high mortality rates (e.g., in burn care), can focus the direction of limited resources toward areas of need.

B.","Little is known about the outcomes of pediatric burn patients in resource-limited and rural locations of the developing world. In March 2013, our pediatric burn unit existing in this setting established an electronic registry of all patients. The authors analyzed the registry to determine overall mortality rates and predictors of mortality, including that of underweight status and body part burned. The secure electronic database of all admissions was reviewed for age, gender, weight, burn percentage (TBSA%), body part burned, cause/place of injury, length of stay, underweight status, surgery performed, reason for discharge, and mortality. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the variables associated with mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were also analyzed. A total of 211 cases (59.7% male) admitted from March 2013 to June 2014 were reviewed. The median age, %TBSA, and length of stay were 2.0 years (1.3-3.3), 8.0% (5.0-13.4), and 8.5 days (4-14). The overall mortality rate was 15/211 (7.1%). Most injuries were unintentional (93.8%) scalds (85.3%) occurring in the home (98.1%). Two factors were significantly associated with mortality in the final multivariable model: %TBSA (odds ratio = 1.31 for 1% increase in %TBSA; 95% confidence interval = 1.17-1.46) and younger age (odds ratio = 0.20; 0.07-0.63). This study characterizes mortality among patients at a pediatric burn unit serving a rural population in the developing world. The majority of pediatric burns were unintentional scalds occurring in the home. %TBSA and lower age were the strongest predictors of mortality.

M.; Mabomva, L.","Purpose: This retrospective study describes the clinical features and management of noma (cancrum oris) in patients with HIV and AIDS. Patients and Methods: Records of 48 consecutive patients with noma (cancrum oris) seen between July 2002 and November 2006 were reviewed for age, gender, clinical features, and management. Other reports on noma in HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe were also reviewed. Results: There were 48 patients included; 35.4% (n = 17) were males, of which 64.7% (n = 11) were children (16 years and younger) and 35.3% (n = 6) were adults; 64.6% (n = 3 1) were females, Out of which 87.1% (n = 27) were children and 12.9% (n = 4) were adults. The average age was 14.2 years (range, 3 to 30 years) for males and 9.2 years (range, I to 36 years) for females. The average age for the entire group was I I years (range, I to 36 years). All patients were HIV-positive by the ELISA method. Only 13 patients had CD4 cell and CD8 cell count obtained, ranging from 10 to 594 cells/mu L with a CD4/CD8 ratio ranging from 0.02 to 0.45. Only 5 patients had microbiologic investigations conducted, isolating Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, group D Streptococcus, and group B hemolytic Streptococcus. Isolated cheek defect (37.5%) was most common, followed by the type I and type W defect (25% each). Administration of antibiotics, nutritional support, wound debridement, and sequestrectomy were conducted before definitive reconstructive surgery. Facial reconstruction was performed using distant and local advancement flaps. No bony reconstruction was performed. Satisfactory results were achieved with minimal infection and flap breakdown. Follow-up was difficult; patients were lost to follow-up within 6 to 12 months after surgery. Conclusion: Noma cases are on the increase in line with the current HIV and AIDS epidemic. Female children appear to be more commonly affected than their male counterparts. Reconstructive surgery is possible in patients with low CD4/CD8 ratios because of HIV infection.

This study determined the burden of hospitalization after burns on women's economic status and its associated HRQOL. METHODS: This was a three-month cross-sectional study of female patients ≥ 25 years, treated of mixed or full thickness burns in four teaching hospitals in south-east Nigeria, discharged between September-November, 2018. Study instruments were participants' case notes for socio-demographic and disease history, interviewer-administered questionnaires, namely-economic-burden-of-burns questionnaire and English version of the EuroQol Five-Dimensions-Three-Level Health Questionnaire for Nigeria. Data were collected on second- or third-day post-discharge through home visits or phone calls. This lasted for 13 weeks. RESULTS: A total of seventy-three female patients with burn were successfully enrolled. Most participants were married, fairly educated, mainly traders or housewives. Thirty-four (46.6%) had subjective estimated family monthly income below NGN 50,000 (low economic status). Participants' average monthly income reduced drastically after hospitalization. Their average family monthly income was NGN110,439 (USD307), while their average total expenses incurred during hospitalization was NGN691,093 (USD1,920). Almost all (93.2%) had at least one surgical intervention during management. Their average length of hospital stay was 35.4 days; eleven consequently lost their job. Many had moderate to severe economic burden of treatment; only eleven could bear all the treatment expenses independently. Anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort were common problems reported, However, these Euroqol dimensions varied according to their SES, education and occupation. Women in the low economic class were more inclined to poor HRQOL (Mean ± SD VAS = 53.33 ± 17.619) than women in high economic class (Mean ± SD VAS = 76.67 ± 21.794). CONCLUSION: Burns places high level of economic burden on women and unfortunately, Nigerian government's commitment to healthcare of burns patients is low. The long course of hospitalization and economic depletion impact negatively on the women's HRQOL. Based on these findings, we recommend that government parastatals create special trust fund for burns treatment and the National Health Insurance Scheme be restructured for more accessibility.",2021,,BMC Womens Health,21,1,85,33639915,10.1186/s12905-021-01232-5,13496,#1932,Chinweuba 2021,"",Burden; Burns; Cost

B.; Pandit, H.","BACKGROUND: We conducted an assessment of orthopaedic surgical capacity in the following countries in East, Central, and Southern Africa: Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. METHODS: We adapted the WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care with questions specific to trauma and orthopaedic care. In May 2013-May 2014, surgeons from the College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA) based at district (secondary) and referral (tertiary) hospitals in the region completed a web-based survey. COSECSA members contacted other eligible hospitals in their country to collect further data. FINDINGS: Data were collected from 267 out of 992 (27%) hospitals, including 185 district hospitals and 82 referral hospitals. Formal accident and emergency departments were present in 31% of hospitals. Most hospitals had no general or orthopaedic surgeons or medically-qualified anaesthetists on staff. Functioning mobile C-arm X-ray machines were available in only 4% of district and 27% of referral hospitals; CT scanning was available in only 3% and 26%, respectively. Closed fracture treatment was offered in 72% of the hospitals.

The burden of trauma in four rural district hospitals in Malawi: A retrospective review of medical records,"Chokotho, L.; Mulwafu, W.; Jacobsen, K. H.; Pandit, H.; Lavy, C.","Background: Few injury surveillance systems collect data in sub-Saharan Africa. This medical record review of four rural hospitals provides baseline data on the burden of trauma in Malawi. Methods: We reviewed all outpatient, inpatient, and mortuary records for one full year at four of the 28 district hospitals in Malawi: Dedza in central Malawi, Mangochi in the east, Nkhata Bay in the north, and Thyolo in the south. We used descriptive and comparative statistics to examine characteristics of patients and the data file. Results: During 2012, 18,735 trauma patients were treated at the four district hospitals. Trauma cases accounted for 3.5% of the 541,170 patient visits. In total, 60.8% of trauma patients were male; 39.1% were 0-14 years old and 50.4% were 15-49 years old. The logbooks were missing information about the primary type of injury for 44.9% of patients and about injury cause for 82.7%. Of the recorded trauma diagnoses, the most common injuries were soft tissue injuries, fractures, and sprains. The most commonly reported causes of injuries were animal bites (mostly dog bites), road traffic injuries, assaults, burns, and falls. Conclusions: The development and implementation of improved methods for acquiring more complete, accurate, and useful trauma data in Malawi and other low-income countries requires addressing difficulties that might result in missing data.

"The Burden of Motorcycle Crash Injuries on the Public Health System in Kisumu City, Kenya","Cholo, W.; Odero, W.; Ogendi, J.","BACKGROUND: In Kenya, the increased use of motorcycles for transport has led to increased morbidity, mortality, and disability. These injuries exert a burden on the public health system, yet little information exists on health care resource usage by motorcycle crash injury patients. We aimed to estimate the burden of motorcycle crash injuries on the health system in Kisumu City. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month prospective study of all motorcycle crash injury patients who presented to 3 Tier III public and private hospitals in Kisumu City between May and November 2019. We collected data on demographics, emergency department (ED) visits, admissions, anatomic injury site, services used, and injury severity. We reviewed hospital records to obtain denominator data on all the conditions presenting to the EDs. RESULTS: A total of 1,073 motorcycle crash injury cases accounted for 2.0%, 12.0%, and 13.6% of total emergency visits, total injuries, and total admissions to the hospitals, respectively. Men were overrepresented (P<.001). The mean age was 29.6 years (±standard deviation [SD] 12.19; range=2-84). The average injury severity score was 12.83. Surgical interventions were required by 89.3% of patients admitted. Of the 123 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, 42.3% were due to motorcycle accident injuries. CONCLUSION: Motorcycle injuries impose a major burden on the Kisumu City public health system.

Surgical care for the direct and indirect victims of violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,"Chu, K.; Havet, P.; Ford, N.; Trelles, M.","BACKGROUND: The provision of surgical assistance in conflict is often associated with care for victims of violence. However, there is an increasing appreciation that surgical care is needed for non-traumatic morbidities. In this paper we report on surgical interventions carried out by Médecins sans Frontières in Masisi, North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo to contribute to the scarce evidence base on surgical needs in conflict. METHODS: We analysed data on all surgical interventions done at Masisi district hospital between September 2007 and December 2009. Types of interventions are described, and logistic regression used to model associations with violence-related injury. RESULTS: 2869 operations were performed on 2441 patients. Obstetric emergencies accounted for over half (675, 57%) of all surgical pathology and infections for another quarter (160, 14%). Trauma-related injuries accounted for only one quarter (681, 24%) of all interventions; among these, 363 (13%) were violence-related. Male gender (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 20.0, p < 0.001), military status (AOR = 4.1, p < 0.001), and age less than 20 years (AOR = 2.1, p < 0.001) were associated with violence-related injury. Immediate peri-operative mortality was 0.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, most surgical interventions were unrelated to violent trauma and rather reflected the general surgical needs of a low-income tropical country. Programs in conflict zones in low-income countries need to be prepared to treat both the war-wounded and non-trauma related life-threatening surgical needs of the general population. Given the limited surgical workforce in these areas, training of local staff and task shifting is recommended to support broad availability of essential surgical care.

Providing surgical care in Somalia: A model of task shifting,"Chu, K. M.; Ford, N. P.; Trelles, M.","BACKGROUND: Somalia is one of the most political unstable countries in the world. Ongoing insecurity has forced an inconsistent medical response by the international community, with little data collection. This paper describes the ""remote"" model of surgical care by Medecins Sans Frontieres, in Guri-El, Somalia. The challenges of providing the necessary prerequisites for safe surgery are discussed as well as the successes and limitations of task shifting in this resource-limited context. METHODS: In January 2006, MSF opened a project in Guri-El located between Mogadishu and Galcayo. The objectives were to reduce mortality due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth and from violent and non-violent trauma. At the start of the program, expatriate surgeons and anesthesiologists established safe surgical practices and performed surgical procedures. After January 2008, expatriates were evacuated due to insecurity and surgical care has been provided by local Somalian doctors and nurses with periodic supervisory visits from expatriate staff. RESULTS: Between October 2006 and December 2009, 2086 operations were performed on 1602 patients. The majority (1049, 65%) were male and the median age was 22 (interquartile range, 17-30). 1460 (70%) of interventions were emergent. Trauma accounted for 76% (1585) of all surgical pathology; gunshot wounds accounted for 89% (584) of violent injuries. Operative mortality (0.5% of all surgical interventions) was not higher when Somalian staff provided care compared to when expatriate surgeons and anesthesiologists. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of surgical care in any conflict-settings is difficult, but in situations where international support is limited, the challenges are more extreme. In this model, task shifting, or the provision of services by less trained cadres, was utilized and peri-operative mortality remained low demonstrating that safe surgical practices can be accomplished even without the presence of fully trained surgeon and anesthesiologists. If security improves in Somalia, on-site training by expatriate surgeons and anesthesiologists will be re-established. Until then, the best way MSF has found to support surgical care in Somalia is continue to support in a ""remote"" manner.",2011,,Confl Health,5,,12,21762491,10.1186/1752-1505-5-12,15183,#1985,Chu 2011,"",Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care
Patient-Proxy and Societal Perspectives of Quality-of-Life Utilities in Children With Cleft Lip and Palate Managed With Surgical Repair vs No Repair in Ethiopia,"Chung, K. Y.; Gebretekle, G. B.; Howard, A.; Pullenayegum, E.; Eshete, M.; Forrest, C. R.; Sander, B.","IMPORTANCE: In Ethiopia, more than 70% of infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) lack access to surgery. Infants who are untreated can experience severe malnutrition and extreme social stigma resulting in abandonment. Utilities are standardized measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that inform health care resource allocation. However, CL/P utilities are missing from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVE: To elicit utilities for untreated and surgically treated children with CL/P with consideration for social determinants of health from patient-proxy and societal participants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used patient proxies and societal participants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from July 1, 2019, to January 30, 2020. Eligible patient proxies were caregivers of children younger than 18 years with nonsyndromic CL/P who were untreated or received surgery. Proxies were necessary as most patients were 0 to 4 years old and cannot reliably self-report. Eligible societal participants were 18 years and older with no family history of CL/P. EXPOSURES: Surgical treatment and social determinants of health. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants measured utilities using the visual analog scale (VAS), time trade-off (TTO), and standard gamble (SG). RESULTS: In this study, 312 patient proxies and 135 societal participants were recruited. Mean (SD) utilities for untreated CL/P ranged from 0.57 (0.23) to 0.70 (0.22) from patient proxies and from 0.35 (0.21) to 0.8 (0.23) from societal participants, depending on utility instrument and cleft type. Surgical treatment was associated with a better HRQOL from the patient-proxy perspective (VAS, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.26; TTO, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.25) from the societal perspective (VAS, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.26; TTO, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.22; SG, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.15). Social determinants of health that were associated with patient-proxy utilities were income above the national mean (VAS, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.17; TTO, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.20), and religion (Christian vs other: TTO, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.03). From the societal perspective, the association between treatment and utilities was smaller in females compared with males (TTO, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that CL/P disease severity and surgical impact in Ethiopia were undervalued by previous estimates from high-income countries and were associated with social determinants of health.

A Systematic Review of the Cost-Effectiveness of Cleft Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: What is Needed?,"Chung, K. Y.; Ho, G.; Erman, A.; Bielecki, J. M.; Forrest, C. R.; Sander, B.","Objective: The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review that summarizes the cost-effectiveness of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on existing literature. Design: We searched eleven electronic databases for articles from January 1, 2000 to December 29, 2020. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020148402). Two reviewers independently conducted primary and secondary screening, and data extraction. Setting: All CL/P cost-effectiveness analyses in LMIC settings. Patients, Participants: In total, 2883 citations were screened. Eleven articles encompassing 1,001,675 patients from 86 LMICs were included. Main Outcome Measures: We used cost-effectiveness thresholds of 1% to 51% of a country's gross domestic product per capita (GDP/capita), a conservative threshold recommended for LMICs. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Results: Primary CL/P repair was cost-effective at the threshold of 51% of a country's GDP/capita across all studies. However, only 1 study met at least 70% of the JBI criteria. There is a need for context-specific cost and health outcome data for primary CL/P repair, complications, and existing multidisciplinary management in LMICs.

Prioritisation of Surgery in the National Health Strategic Plans of Africa: A Systematic Review,"Citron, I.; Chokotho, L.; Lavy, C.","INTRODUCTION: Disease amenable to surgical intervention accounts for 11-15 % of world disability and there is increasing interest in surgery as a global public health issue. National Health Strategic Plans (NHSPs) reflect countries' long-term health priorities, plans and targets. These plans were analysed to assess the prioritisation of surgery as a public health issue in Africa. METHODS: NHSPs of 43 independent Sub-Saharan African countries available in the public domain in March 2014 in French or English were searched electronically for key terms: surg*, ortho*, trauma, cancer, appendic*, laparotomy, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria. They were then searched manually for disease prevalence, targets, and human resources. RESULTS: 19 % of NHSPs had no mention of surgery or surgical conditions. 63 % had five or less mentions of surgery. HIV and malaria had 3772 mentions across all the policies, compared to surgery with only 376 mentions. Trauma had 239 mentions, while the common surgical conditions of appendicitis, laparotomy and hernia had no mentions at all. Over 95 % of NHSPs specifically mentioned the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, infant mortality and maternal mortality. Whereas, the most commonly mentioned surgical condition for which a prevalence was given was trauma, in only 47 % of policies. All NHSPs had plans and measurable targets for the reduction of HIV and tuberculosis. Of the total 4064 health targets, only 2 % were related to surgical conditions or surgical care. 33 % of policies had no surgical targets. DISCUSSION: NHSPs are the best available measure of health service and planning priorities. It is clear from our findings that surgery is poorly represented and that surgical conditions and surgical treatment are not widely recognised as a public health priority. Greater prioritisation of surgery in national health strategic policies is required to build resilient surgical systems.",2016,,World J Surg,40,4,779-83,26711637,10.1007/s00268-015-3333-9,14755,#2011,Citron 2016,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-13 04:49:48)(Select): general surgical capacity / barriers to care

Challenges in global microsurgery: A six year review of outcomes at an East African hospital,"Citron, I.; Galiwango, G.; Hodges, A.","SummaryBackground Free tissue transfer is an invaluable resource for reconstruction of complex defects. There is very little evidence as to the feasibility and outcomes of microsurgery performed in East Africa. This study will analyse outcomes of 114 consecutive free flaps, performed over 6 years at a single plastic surgery unit in Uganda. It aims to demonstrate that despite its challenges, successful microsurgical practice can be set up in East Africa. Methods and patients The notes of 100 consecutive patients who underwent 114 free flaps between 01/06/2009 and 01/07/2015 at CoRSU Hospital, Uganda were analysed. Results One hundred and fourteen free flaps were performed on 100 patients. The types of free flaps used included free fibula (n = 41), ALT (n = 30), gracillis (n = 8), radial forearm (n = 7), latissimus dorsi (n = 9) and rectus (n = 7) amongst others (n = 12). The most common indications for surgery were head and neck cancer (n = 50), trauma (n = 19), osteomyelitis (n = 18), burns (n = 13), head and neck infection (n = 6). Over the six year period there was an overall 76% survival of the flaps. However in the last two years of the series there was a flap survival rate of over 93% (n = 50). There were 40 non-microsurgical complications including wound infection (n = 10) and graft loss (n = 8). Conclusion This is one of the first studies to report on the outcomes of free flaps performed at an East African centre. There is a steep but surmountable learning curve to improve microsurgery delivery in East Africa.

Facial human bites. Vision on STMMs in Africa,"Clarós, P.; Końska, N.; Clarós, A.","Objectives: Human bites of the face are a frequent and serious health issue as they often compromise patients function and aesthetics as well as lead to further complications. The aim of the study is to review human bites of the face referred to our team during 112 short-term medical missions (STMMs) in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past 20 years and to discuss the epidemiology, appearance, management and outcome, including the most common complications. Methods: A retrospective medical documentation review was carried out examining all human bites of the face operated by our team during 112 STMMs from 2000 to 2019 in different countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. Results: Out of about 5500 patients medical charts 51 patients were selected due to history of human bite. Patients’ age range was 15–65 years, female to male ratio was 1, 55:1, the most often involved parts were: lips, ear and nose. Various surgical procedures were carried out including local flaps and free grafts. Infection and graft necrosis were the most common reported complication (n = 4; 9.3%).

Prevalence of Pediatric Surgical Conditions Across Somaliland,"Concepcion, T.; Mohamed, M.; Dahir, S.; Adan Ismail, E.; Poenaru, D.; Rice, H. E.; Smith, E. R.","IMPORTANCE: Although surgical conditions are increasingly recognized as causing a significant health care burden among adults in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), the burden of surgical conditions among children in LMICs remains poorly defined. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of pediatric surgical conditions across Somaliland using a nationwide community-based household survey. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted through a national community-based sampling survey from August through December 2017 in Somaliland. Participants were 1503 children surveyed using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The SOSAS survey contains 2 components, including a section on household demographics, deaths, and financial information and sections querying children's history of surgical conditions. RESULTS: In this cross-sectional study that included 1503 children (55.6% male; mean [SE] age, 6.4 [0.1] years), 221 surgical conditions were identified among 196 children, yielding a mean (SE) prevalence of pediatric surgical conditions of 12.2% (1.5%). Only 53 of these 221 surgical conditions (23.7%) had been surgically corrected at the time of the survey. The most common conditions encountered were congenital anomalies (33.8%) and wound-related injuries (24.6%). Nationally, an estimated 256 745 children have surgical conditions, with an estimated 88 345 to 199 639 children having unmet surgical needs.

"Ten-year experience of more than 35,000 orofacial clefts in Africa","Conway, J. C.; Taub, P. J.; Kling, R.; Oberoi, K.; Doucette, J.; Jabs, E. W.","Background: Surgical correction of orofacial clefts greatly mitigates negative outcomes. However, access to reconstructive surgery is limited in developing countries. The present study reviews epidemiological data from a single charitable organization, Smile Train, with a database of surgical cases from 33 African countries from 2001-2011. Methods: Demographic and clinical patient data were collected from questionnaires completed by the participating surgeons. These data were recorded in Excel, analyzed using SPSS and compared with previously reported data. Results: Questionnaires were completed for 36,384 patients by 389 African surgeons. The distribution of clefts was: 34.44% clefts of the lip (CL), 58.87% clefts of the lip and palate (CLP), and 6.69% clefts of the palate only (CP). The male to female ratio was 1.46:1, and the unilateral: bilateral ratio 2.93:1, with left-sided predominance 1.69:1. Associated anomalies were found in 4.18% of patients. The most frequent surgeries included primary lip/nose repairs, unilateral (68.36%) and bilateral (11.84%). There was seasonal variation in the frequency of oral cleft births with the highest in January and lowest by December. The average age at surgery was 9.34 years and increased in countries with lower gross domestic products. The average hospital stay was 4.5 days. The reported complication rate was 1.92%. Conclusions: With the exception of cleft palates, results follow trends of worldwide epidemiologic reports of 25% CL, 50% CLP, and 25% CP, 2:1 unilateral:bilateral and left:right ratios, and male predominance. Fewer than expected patients, especially females, presented with isolated cleft palates, suggesting that limitations in economic resources and cultural aesthetics of the obvious lip deformity may outweigh functional concerns and access to treatment for females. A fewer than expected associated anomalies suggests either true ethnic variation, or that more severely-affected patients are not presenting for treatment. The epidemiology of orofacial clefting in Africa has been difficult to assess due to the diversity of the continent and the considerable variation among study designs. The large sample size of the data collected provides a basis for further study of the epidemiology of orofacial clefting in Africa.",2015,,BMC Psychiatry,15,1,,,10.1186/s12887-015-0328-5,20320,#2090,Conway 2015,"",Burden; Cleft Palate
The Cost of Providing District-Level Surgery in Malawi,"Cornelissen, D.; Mwapasa, G.; Gajewski, J.; McCauley, T.; Borgstein, E.; Brugha, R.; Bijlmakers, L.","Three district hospitals in Malawi that provide essential surgery, which for many patients can be lifesaving or prevent disability, formed the setting of this costing study. All resources used at district hospitals for the delivery of surgery were identified and quantified. The hospital departments were divided into three categories of cost centres-the final cost centre, intermediate and ancillary cost centres. All costs of human resources, buildings, equipment, medical and non-medical supplies and utilities were quantified and allocated to surgery through step-down accounting. The total cost of surgery, including post-operative care, ranged from US$ 329,000 per year to more than twice that amount at one of the hospitals. At two hospitals, it represented 16-17% of the total cost of running the hospital. The main cost drivers of surgery were transport and inpatient services, including catering. The cost of a C-section ranged from $ 164 to 638 that of a hernia repair from $ 137 to 598. Evacuations from uterus were cheapest mainly because of the shorter duration of patient stay. Low bed occupancy rates and utilisation rates of the operating theatres suggest overcapacity but may also indicate a potential to scale up surgery. This may be achieved by adding surgical staff, although there may be rate-limiting steps, such as demand for surgery in the community or capacity to provide anaesthesia. If a scale-up of surgery cannot be realised, hospital managers may be forced to reduce the number of beds, reorganise wards and/or reallocate staff to achieve better economies of scale.",2018,,World J.Surg.,42,1,46-53,WOS:000418579500008,10.1007/s00268-017-4166-5,23980,#2101,Cornelissen 2018,Sabina Rodriguez (2025-02-11 09:10:01)(Select): Provides some information and disaggregation by types of surgery (injury-related surgery which includes skin grafting).

"Global variation in cleft palate repairs: An analysis of 352,191 primary cleft repairs in low- to higher-middle-income countries","Cubitt, J. J.; Hodges, A. M.; Van Lierde, K. M.; Swan, M. C.","Results: A significant correlation exists between both the income of a country and its geographical region to the ratio of lip and palate repair procedures undertaken. Higher-income countries had a higher ratio of cleft palate repairs. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest proportion of cleft palate repairs. Methods: Data were obtained from the Smile Train database of 352,191 consecutive cleft operations performed between 2008 and 2011 in low- to higher-middle-income countries. The ratio of cleft lip to palate repair was analyzed as a function of geographic region and by country income (gross national income). Conclusion: This study emphasizes that many babies born with cleft palates in resource-poor regions do not have their palates repaired. This finding may be explained by an increased neonatal mortality in cleft palate babies. Furthermore, fewer isolated palatal clefts may present to an appropriate health care facility or there may be a reluctance to treat cleft palate due to concerns regarding higher perioperative risks or the lack of available surgical and anesthetic expertise. Objectives: Resources for repair of cleft lip and palate may be lacking in low- and middle-income countries. The Smile Train is a registered charity that supports cleft repair in resource-poor settings.

"Quantifying the Burden of Unmet Upper Extremity Care Need in Low-Middle Income Countries: A Four-Country, Cluster-Randomized Study","Davé, D. R.; Kushner, A. L.; Manske, M. C.","PURPOSE: Currently, no nationally implementable survey exists to identify the burden of hand and upper extremity conditions at the household level in low-middle income countries (LMICs). This study describes a randomized cluster survey approach to estimating the burden of hand and upper extremity conditions in four LMICs using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey. Additionally, this study identifies factors associated with responses of unmet surgical need at the multinational level. METHODS: The SOSAS instrument is a cluster-randomized, cross-sectional, countrywide survey of households administered in Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda from 2011 to 2014. We identified nationwide trends for sociodemographic, anatomic, condition type, mechanism, prevalence, subjective disability, and barriers to care for upper extremity survey responses. A multivariable model identified factors associated with unmet upper extremity need across the four nations. RESULTS: Across the four countries, 13,763 individuals participated in the survey, with 883 conditions of the upper extremity identified (7.4% of all surgical conditions surveyed). Fractures accompanied many of the injuries (32.3%). Although most conditions were acquired, congenital conditions comprised 11% of all etiologies. Overall, open fire/explosion was the most common mechanism (22.9%). Rwandans had the highest proportion of individuals seeking care (91.0%) and receiving care (88.6%). Sierra Leone indicated the fewest seeking and receiving care (71% and 63%, respectively). Chronic injuries were significantly associated with receiving care, whereas illiteracy and worsening subjective disability were barriers to receiving care. CONCLUSIONS: In this survey of upper extremity conditions from four LMICs, upper extremity conditions primarily resulted from fire/explosions, and many reported sustaining a fracture. Illiteracy and more disabling conditions decreased the odds of receiving care by 30% to 40%, respectively.

When located within the head, face, and neck region, plastic surgeons are particularly trained to treat these conditions. The purpose of this study was to describe the etiology, disability, and barriers to receiving care for diseases of the head, face, mouth, and neck region across 4 low-and-middle-income countries. METHODS: The Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) instrument is a cluster randomized, cross-sectional, national survey administered in Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda from 2011 to 2014.

OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic costs of orthopedic injuries were estimated by examining both the direct hospital cost of orthopedic care as well as indirect costs of orthopedic trauma using disability days and loss of work as proxies. METHODS: This study surveyed 200 patients seen in the outpatient orthopedic ward of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, a tertiary hospital in Northeastern Tanzania, during the month of July 2016. FINDINGS: Of the patients surveyed, 88.8% earn a monthly income of less than $250 and the majority of patients (73.7%) reported that the healthcare costs of their musculoskeletal injuries were a catastrophic burden to them and their family with 75.0% of patients reporting their medical costs exceeded their monthly income. The majority (75.3%) of patients lost more than 30 days of activities of daily living due to their injury, with a median (IQR) functional day loss of 90 (30). Post-injury disability led to 40.6% of patients losing their job and 86.7% of disabled patients reported a wage decrease post-injury. There were significant associations between disability and post-injury unemployment (p < .0001) as well as lower post-injury wages (p = .022).

METHODS: A six-year (2004-2009) prospective study on the challenges and outcome of children referred for surgical management of hemangioma/vascular tumors was undertaken at the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria. FINDINGS: Sixty-three children aged between a day and six years (median 5 years) comprising 38 males and 25 females (ratio 1.5:1) were managed. Upper limbs involvement, 18 (28.6%), and face/neck, 12 (19.1%), were most common and were present at birth in 27 (42.9%) babies, appeared between 2-3 weeks in 32 (50.8%), and after six months in 4 (6.3%). Cavernous hemangioma in 19 (30.2%) children, mixed cavernous/strawberry in 31 (49.2%) and strawberry in 13 (20.6), were the major types that ranged from spot-like to extensive huge lesions measuring 12×15 cm in diameter. Failure of 46 (65.1%) cases to respond to non operative treatment, ulceration in 3 (4.8%), infection in 5 (7.9%) and hemorrhage in 2 (3.2%) were indications for surgical intervention. Surgical options included complete excision and primary wound closure in 34 (54%) children, immediate skin graft after complete excision in 10 (15.9%), injection sclerotherapy in 2 (3.2%), serial ligation of feeder vessels in 2 (3.2%), and conservative treatment in 5 (7.9%). Excision and primary wound closure gave better outcome compared with others (P<0.0001). No mortality was recorded on 1-6 years follow-up but ugly scar, 8 (12.7%) and limb deformity, 3 (4.8%) were problems. CONCLUSION: Surgical excision and primary wound closure gave good outcome which could be employed in complicated and hemangioma which failed to respond to other treatment in regions with limited resources.",2011,,Iran J Pediatr,21,3,350-6,23056812,,15205,#2224,DavidOsifo 2011,"",""
The Timing of Operative Intervention for Pediatric Burn Patients in Malawi,"Davis, D.; An, S.; Kayange, L.; Wolf, L.; Boddie, O.; Charles, A.; Gallaher, J.","BACKGROUND: Defining the optimal timing of operative intervention for pediatric burn patients in a resource-limited environment is challenging. We sought to characterize the association between mortality and the timing of operative intervention at a burn center in Lilongwe, Malawi. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of burn patients (<18 years old) presenting to Kamuzu Central Hospital from 2011 to 2022. We compared patients who underwent excision and/or burn grafting based on the timing of the operation. We used logistic regression modeling to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of death based on the timing of surgery. RESULTS: We included 2502 patients with a median age of 3 years (IQR 1-5) and a male preponderance (56.8%). 411 patients (16.4%) had surgery with a median time to surgery of 18 days (IQR 8-34). The crude mortality rate among all patients was 17.0% and 9.1% among the operative cohort. The odds ratio of mortality for patients undergoing surgery within 3 days from presentation was 5.00 (95% CI 2.19, 11.44) after adjusting for age, sex, % total burn surface area (TBSA), and flame burn. The risk was highest for the youngest patients. CONCLUSIONS: Children who underwent burn excision and/or grafting in the first 3 days of hospitalization had a much higher risk of death than patients undergoing surgical intervention later. Delaying operative intervention till >72 h for pediatric patients, especially those under 5 years old, may confer a survival advantage.

W.; Biset, G.","Background: According to global estimates, Africa has the largest number of paediatric burn admissions. In Ethiopia, burn was the second leading cause of death among children from unintentional injuries. So far, no research had been conducted regarding the treatment outcomes of burn n children, particularly at DCSH. Objective: To evaluate burn treatment outcomes and associated factors in children who visited DCSH, 2021. Methods: An institutional based cross-sectional study design and simple random sampling method was used to select the study participants. A total of 250 charts of hospitalized children from September 1, 2011 to August 30, 2015 were reviewed. Cronbach's alpha test was done on the data collecting tool which scored 0.8. Data were entered, cleaned using Epi-Data version 4.6, and analysed using SPSS version 20. P-values less than 0.2 in binary logistic regression were entered in multivariable logistic regression.

E.; Jalloh, A.","Background: Plastic surgery (PS) in Africa is a relatively young surgery specialty, and the number of available plastic surgeons on average is one or two surgeons per country in many African low-income countries. This systematic review aims to geographically map the research activities through scientific publications of African PS centres, between February 2012-February 2023. Methods: We searched four literature databases (Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and African Journal Online) and did a manual search. We included case reports, randomised controlled trials, and clinical, comparative, observational and multicentre studies conducted in Africa and published in English and French. In the Google Scholar database, we analysed the first 200 references (scientific articles) selected per relevance according to the Boolean terms. In the African Journals Online database, we analysed the references from the first five pages. The selected keywords were: burns, trauma reconstruction, pressure injuries, wound, cleft lip and palate, breast reconstruction, microsurgery, aesthetic surgery, face surgery, head and neck surgery, hand surgery, open fracture surgery, oculoplastic surgery, skin surgery, and soft tissue surgery. Results: We retrieved a total of 228 articles. Out of the 73 African centres we identified, 27 were in the North, 22 in the West, 8 in the East, 3 in the Centre, and 14 in the South. Most of the retrieved 228 articles involved burns (60, 26.31%), congenital abnormalities (52, 22.80%) and reconstruction (28,12.80%); however, other conditions, such as breast or skin cancer, hand surgery, microsurgery or aesthetics are emerging.

"Cleft lip and palate surgery in Kumasi, Ghana: 2001-2005","Donkor, P.; Bankas, D. O.; Agbenorku, P.; Plange-Rhule, G.; Ansah, S. K.","Background: A retrospective review of cleft lip operations at our hospital during 1991-2000 showed that on average 17 patients per year were operated on for cleft lip and palate and that each year saw an increasing number of patients being treated. The purpose of this study was to determine the change that had occurred in the number of patients treated for cleft lip and palate during the five-year period from 2001-2005. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective review of cleft lip and palate operations carried out under general anesthesia at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. Operating room records were the source of data. Patients treated under local anesthesia were excluded. Information collected included age, gender, and diagnosis. The results were displayed in tables and graphs. Results: A total of 344 patients were operated for cleft lip and palate during the five-year period, i.e. 69 operations per year. The patients comprised 58% males and 42% females and ranged in age from 1 month to 32 years with a mean age of 3.9 years. Unilateral cleft lip operations constituted 78% of all operations. Each succeeding year saw an increase in the number of operations being carried out year during the five-year period. Conclusion: The marked increase in the number of cleft operations per year in our hospital during the period under study was probably due to greater awareness in the community; free surgeries provided by local surgeons with financial support from a US-based NGO; and free operations by a visiting surgical team. Financial, logistical and training support to cleft teams in developing countries is likely to lead to more surgeries for children with cleft. © 2007 Muntaz B.

A prospective surgery of patients with cleft lip and palate in kumasi,"Donkor, P.; Plange-Rhule, G.; Amponsah, E. K.","Background: There has been a steady increase in the number of patients with cleft lip and palate being treated at our hospital. Objective. The aim of the study was to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of patients with cleft lip and palate as seen in a hospital setting. Methods: New and consecutive patients with cleft lip and palate attending the maxillofacial clinic during the period between February 2003 and January 2004 were prospectively surveyed. Data including age of child, gender, address, type of cleft, associated birth anomalies, family history of cleft, mother's age at birth of child, mother's occupation, and mother's smoking and drinking habits were collected and analyzed using a SPSS package. Results: Seventy-four new cases of cleft lip and palate were seen comprising 33 males and 41 females. Their ages ranged from one day old to 21 years with an overall mean age of 10 months. Cleft lip alone (57%) was the most common presentation. Seventy percent of the mothers were less than 30 years of age. Majority (76%) lived in the Ashanti Region, i.e. within less than 80 kilometres from the clinic. No patient had a family history of facial cleft. Ninety-three percent of the mothers were either unemployed or worked in jobs considered as low earning which included dressmaking, hairdressing, peasant farming, and petty trading. None of the mothers smoked or drank alcohol either before or during the pregnancy. Conclusion: Cleft lip and palate was more commonly seen in low income families. The mothers were found to be relatively young. None of the patients and mothers had a family history of cleft.

The goals of this study are 1) to acquire burn-patient demographics for the Eastern Province, Zambia and 2) to assess the early impact of the ABA/CBF-sponsored burn teams. This is a retrospective chart review of burn patients admitted in one mission hospital in Katete, Zambia, July 2002 to June 2009. July 2002 to December 2006 = data before ABA/CBF burn teams and January 2007 to June 2009 = burn care data during/after burn outreach. There were 510 burn patients hospitalized, male:female ratio 1.2:1. Average age = 15.6 years, with 44% younger than 5 years. Average TBSA burned = 11% and mean fatal TBSA = 25%. Average hospital length of stay = 16.9 days survivors and 11.6 days nonsurvivors. Most common mechanisms of burn injuries: flame (52%) and scald (41%). Ninety-two patients (18%) died and 23 (4.5%) left against medical advice. There were 191 (37.4%) patients who underwent 410 surgical procedures (range 1-13/patient). There were 138 (33.7%) sloughectomies, 118 (28.7%) skin grafts, 39 (9.5%) amputations, and 115 (28.1%) other procedures. Changes noted in the 2007 to 2009 time period: more patients had burn diagrams (48.6 vs 27.6%, P < .001), received analgesics (91 vs 84%, P = .05), resuscitation fluid (56 vs 49%, P = not significant [NS]), topical antimicrobials (40 vs 37%, P = NS), underwent skin grafting (35.5 vs 25.1%, P = NS), and underwent any operative intervention (40.6 vs 35.2%, P = NS), compared with patients treated between 2002 and 2006. This study represents the largest, most comprehensive burn data set for a sub-Saharan region in Africa. There has been a statistically significant improvement in documentation of burn size as well as administration of analgesics, validating the efficacy of the ABA/CBF-sponsored burn teams.

A cross-sectional survey of essential surgical capacity in Somalia,"Elkheir, N.; Sharma, A.; Cherian, M.; Saleh, O. A.; Everard, M.; Popal, G. R.; Ibrahim, A. A.","Objective: To assess life-saving and disability-preventing surgical services (including emergency, trauma, obstetrics, anaesthesia) of health facilities in Somalia and to assist in the planning of strategies for strengthening surgical care systems. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Health facilities in all 3 administrative zones of Somalia; northwest Somalia (NWS), known as Somaliland; northeast Somalia (NES), known as Puntland; and south/central Somalia (SCS). Participants: 14 health facilities. Measures: The WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was employed to capture a health facility's capacity to deliver surgical and anaesthesia services by investigating four categories of data: infrastructure, human resources, interventions available and equipment. Results: The 14 facilities surveyed in Somalia represent 10 of the 18 districts throughout the country. The facilities serve an average patient population of 331 250 people, and 12 of the 14 identify as hospitals. While major surgical procedures were provided at many facilities (caesarean section, laparotomy, appendicectomy, etc), only 22% had fully available oxygen access, 50% fully available electricity and less than 30% had any management guidelines for emergency and surgical care. Furthermore, only 36% were able to provide general anaesthesia inhalation due to lack of skills, supplies and equipment. Basic supplies for airway management and the prevention of infection transmission were severely lacking in most facilities. Conclusions: According to the results of the WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care survey, there exist significant gaps in the capacity of emergency and essential surgical services in Somalia including inadequacies in essential equipment, service provision and infrastructure.

G.","IMPORTANCE: Surgical care is widely unavailable in developing countries; advocates recommend that countries evaluate and report on access to surgical care to improve availability and aid health planners in decision making. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the infrastructure, capacity, and availability of surgical care in Zambia to inform health policy priorities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this observational study, all hospitals providing surgical care were identified in cooperation with the Zambian Ministry of Health. On-site data collection was conducted from February 1 through August 30, 2011, with an adapted World Health Organization Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care survey. Data collection at each facility included interviews with hospital personnel and assessment of material resources. Data were geocoded and analyzed in a data visualization platform from March 1 to December 1, 2015. We analyzed time and distance to surgical services, as well as the proportion of the population living within 2 hours from a facility providing surgical care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Surgical capacity, supplies, human resources, and infrastructure at each surgical facility, as well as the population living within 2 hours from a hospital providing surgical care. RESULTS: Data were collected from all 103 surgical facilities identified as providing surgical care. When including all surgical facilities (regardless of human resources and supplies), 14.9% of the population (2 166 460 of 14 500 000 people) lived more than 2 hours from surgical care. However, only 17 hospitals (16.5%) met the World Health Organization minimum standards of surgical safety; when limiting the analysis to these hospitals, 65.9% of the population (9 552 780 people) lived in an area that was more than 2 hours from a surgical facility. Geographic analysis of emergency and essential surgical care, defined as access to trauma care, obstetric care, and care of common abdominal emergencies, found that 80.7% of the population (11 704 700 people) lived in an area that was more than 2 hours from these surgical facilities.

Motorcycle Road Traffic Injuries in a Tertiary Hospital in Nigeria: A Reflection of the Trauma Care Crisis,"Ezeme, C.; Oladeji, E. O.; Baiyewu, L. A.; Okunola, M. O.; Ogunlade, S. O.","BACKGROUND:  Motorcycle is a popular and growing form of intracity transportation in many Nigerian cities owing mainly to poorly developed transport systems. It contributes significantly to road traffic injuries (RTIs), which are a leading cause of death and disabilities in low- and middle-income countries. There is a lack of information on the quality of care received and the treatment outcome in patients with motorcycle RTIs in Ibadan and many cities in Nigeria. This study evaluated the characteristics of motorcycle-related RTIs, the quality of care received, and the outcome of the patients managed in a trauma reference center in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS:  This is a prospective cohort study. All patients involved in motorcycle road traffic crashes who presented to the emergency department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, between August 2020 and May 2021, were included in the study. Data on patients' demographics, history of the crash, injuries sustained, definitive care, and the outcome of in-hospital care were obtained from patients (and/or their carers) and the medical records. RESULTS:  A total of 156 patients were seen, out of which 74.4% were males. About 76.2% were less than 45 years with a mean age of 35.7 ± 16.3 years, and the peak age group was 18-44 years. About 37 (23.7%) patients were involved in motorcycle/motorcycle collisions, whereas 67 (42.9%) were involved in motorcycle/car collisions. Riders accounted for 59.6% (93), and although 62% (97) of the patients presented within six hours of the crash, only 10.9% (17) presented within one hour. About 48% received some form of prehospital care rendered by officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps, police officers, or passers-by, and none was attended by a dedicated emergency ambulance team. The head and the limbs were the most affected anatomical areas, while orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures were the most required emergency surgical interventions. About 66.7% were discharged home with only 21.2% of them fit to return to pre-trauma function at discharge, and the mortality rate was 17.3%. Patients who presented at 7-24 hours (AOR = 2.99; 95% CI = 1.04-8.62; p-value = 0.043) and >24 hours after the accident (AOR = 5.65; 95% CI = 1.64-19.53; p-value = 0.006) were 2.99 and 5.65 times, respectively, more likely to die from motorcycle-related accident compared to those who presented within the first six hours. CONCLUSION:  This study identified the growing burden of disabilities and mortalities related to motorcycle RTIs.

Management outcome and associated factors in burn injuries with and without facial involvement in a Nigerian population,"Fatusi, O. A.; Fatusi, A. O.; Olabanji, J. K.; Alatise, O. I.","There is a high potential for the occurrence of burns in Nigeria, yet very little is known about factors that are associated with management outcomes (death/survivorship) in burns affecting facial or other body areas among Nigerian populations. This study aimed at determining patterns of occurrences of burn injuries with and without facial involvement and the factors that are associated with mortality. A standardized data-collection instrument was designed and used to extract relevant information about burn patients that were seen at the Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospitals Complex, Ile-Ife, Nigeria, between 1998 and 2003. During the study period, fuel-related flames constituted the leading type of agent in both facial (71.1%) and nonfacial involved burns (65.3%). There was no significant difference in the incidence of contracture and inhalation injury between burns with facial involvement and burns without facial involvement, but cases of facial involvement have significantly lower incidences of wound infections. No significant difference was seen in the incidence of mortality between burns with facial involvement (31.6 %) and burns without facial involvement (30.7%). Significant bivariate correlates for mortality were age, flame as the agent of burns, depth of the burns and wound infections.

The impact of a single surgical intervention for patients with a cleft lip living in rural Ethiopia,"Fell, M. J.; Hoyle, T.; Abebe, M. E.; Kebede, Y.; Medhin, Y. D.; Hiwot, F. A.; Cifeta, T. H.; Ali, I. M.; McGurk, M.","BACKGROUND: Humanitarian organisations commonly provide reconstructive treatment for patients with cleft lip within developing countries, but follow-up is often non-existent, particularly for those living in rural areas. This study aimed to assess whether a single surgical intervention was sufficient to produce an observable change to the life of a patient with cleft lip living in rural Hararghe in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: 356 patients with isolated cleft lips, who received a single surgical treatment at least 6 months previously, were evaluated in 21 rural health centres. RESULTS: Patients and their families expressed unhappiness before treatment, mainly because the society reacted negatively towards the deformities, isolating the patients from community activities. Postoperatively, the percentage of school-aged children participating in education increased from 46% to 79%, some older patients were able to marry, but employment was unaffected. The prevalence of wound dehiscence in the lip repair was 3% and occurred more frequently in patients with a bilateral cleft lip compared to a unilateral cleft lip (p < 0.001, RR 49.25, 95% CI 6.7-1037.35).

Our study gives epidemiological description of mandibular fractures in Ghana and also evaluates the relevance of closed reduction and indirect fixation for managing mandibular fractures in low-resource health facilities in low-income countries like Ghana. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective study involving 268 patients who reported to the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Sunyani Regional Hospital with mandibular fractures from January 2010 to December 2019. Patient medical records were assessed for information on age, sex, fracture etiology, anatomic location of fracture, time of day of road traffic accident, and other associated injuries. Results: A total of 268 patients were included in this study (males, 216 [80.6%]; females, 52 [19.4%]). Motor vehicular accident (MVA) was the leading cause of mandibular fractures (202 injuries, 75.4%). Other etiologies included assault (39, 14.6%), gunshot (13, 4.9%), falls (12, 4.5%), and industrial accidents (2, 0.7%).

The goal of our study is to describe the face, head, and neck (FHN) conditions that need surgical care in Uganda, along with barriers to that care and disability from these conditions. METHODS: A 2-stage cluster randomized SOSAS survey was administered in a cross-sectional manner between August and September 2014. Participants included randomly selected persons in 105 enumeration areas in 74 districts throughout Uganda with 24 households in each cluster. The SOSAS survey collected demographic and clinical data on all respondents. Univariate and multivariate logistic models evaluated associations of demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics of the FHN conditions and outcomes of whether health care was sought or surgical care was received. RESULTS: Of the 4428 respondents, 331 (7.8%) reported having FHN conditions. The most common types of conditions were injury-related wounds. Of those who reported an FHN condition, 36% reported receiving no surgical care whereas 82.5% reported seeking health care. In the multivariate model, literacy and type of condition were significant predictors of seeking health care whereas village type, literacy, and type of condition remained significant predictors of receiving surgical care.

Role of mobile health on patient enrollment for cleft lip-palate surgery: A comparative study using SMS blast text messaging in zimbabwe,"Gadkaree, S. K.; Tollefson, T. T.; Fuller, J. C.; Muchemwa, F. C.; Gonga, A.; Shaye, D. A.","Background: Patients' lack of awareness of available services is a significant barrier to delivering surgical care in resource-limited settings. Short message service (SMS) text messaging is a potential means to disseminate this information in resource-limited settings, where rates of mobile phone usage are high. Methods: A blast SMS text informing local populations of upcoming cleft lip-palate (CLP) surgical services was distributed to 25% of the subscriber base 1 week prior to arrival of a (CLP) surgical team in Zimbabwe. A retrospective cohort analysis comparing characteristics of patients presenting to the CLP clinic in the year prior to (2016) and 2 years following (2017–2018) the implementation of the blast SMS text messaging system is performed to assess its impact. Results: Patients presenting to a single Zimbabwean CLP surgical program in the years with SMS messaging notifications were significantly more likely (52 [64%] vs. 5 [17%], P <.001) to have been informed of surgical services through their mobile phones. The average distance traveled per patient was not significantly different prior to implementation of mass text messaging (180.4 km [SD114.8] vs. 167.4 km [SD105.9], P =.580).

Building paediatric surgical capacity to meet SSA country needs is a priority. This study aimed to assess district hospital paediatric surgical capacity in three countries: Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia (MTZ). Methods: Data from 67 district-level hospitals in MTZ were collected using a PediPIPES survey tool. Its five components are procedures, personnel, infrastructure, equipment, and supplies. A PediPIPES Index was calculated for each country, and a two-tailed analysis of variance test was used to explore cross-country comparisons. Results: Similar paediatric surgical capacity index scores and shortages were observed across countries, greater in Malawi and less in Tanzania. Almost all hospitals reported the capacity to perform common minor surgical procedures and less complex resuscitation interventions. Capacity to undertake common abdominal, orthopaedic and urogenital procedures varied—more often reported in Malawi and less often in Tanzania. There were no paediatric or general surgeons or anaesthesiologists at district hospitals. General medical officers with some training to do surgery on children were present (more often in Zambia). Paediatric surgical equipment and supplies were poor in all three countries. Malawi district hospitals had the poorest supply of electricity and water. Conclusions: With no specialists in district hospitals in MTZ, access to safe paediatric surgery is compromised, aggravated by shortages of infrastructure, equipment and supplies. Significant investments are required to address these shortfalls. SSA countries need to define what procedures are appropriate to national, referral and district hospital levels and ensure that an appropriate paediatric surgical workforce is in place at district hospitals, trained and supervised to undertake these essential surgical procedures so as to meet population needs.",2023,,Frontiers in Pediatrics,11,,,,10.3389/fped.2023.1189676,16035,#3108,Gajewski 2023,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-14 02:05:55)(Select): surgical capacity; barriers to care; Rachel Wangi (2025-02-12 00:02:11)(Select): points to surgical capacity. procedures included management of burns and skin grafting ; ,Barriers to Care; Children / Pediatric Population; Surgical Capacity
Access to Operative Intervention Reduces Mortality in Adult Burn Patients in a Resource-Limited Setting in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Gallaher, J. R.; Banda, W.; Robinson, B.; Purcell, L. N.; Charles, A.","INTRODUCTION: Early excision and grafting remains the standard of care after burn injury. However, in a resource-limited setting, operative capacity often limits patient access to surgical intervention. This study sought to describe access to excision and grafting for adult burn patients in a sub-Saharan African burn unit and its relationship with burn-associated mortality. METHODS: We analyzed patients recorded in the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Registry in Lilongwe, Malawi from 2011-2019. We examined patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes for adults aged ≥16 years. Modified Poisson regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-three patients were included. Median age was 30 years (IQR 23-40) with a male preponderance (63%). Median percent total body surface area burned (%TBSA) was 15% (IQR 8-26) and 68% of burns were caused by flame. 27% (n = 154) had burn excision with skin grafting, with a median time to operation of 18 days (IQR 9-38). When adjusted for age, %TBSA, and time to presentation, operative intervention conferred a survival benefit for patients with flame burns with a RR 0.16 (95% CI 0.06, 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In a resource-limiting setting, access to the operating room is inadequate, and burn patients are not prioritized. While many scald burn patients may be managed with wound care alone, patients with flame burn require surgical intervention to improve clinical outcomes. Burn injury in this region continues to confer a high risk of mortality, and more investment in operative capacity is imperative.",2020,,World J Surg,44,11,3629-3635,32666267,10.1007/s00268-020-05684-y,13563,#3117,Gallaher 2020,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-22 03:14:40)(Select): barriers to access; burden --> burns; ,Access to Healthcare; Burns
Burn care delivery in a sub-Saharan African unit: A cost analysis study,"Gallaher, J. R.; Mjuweni, S.; Cairns, B. A.; Charles, A. G.","Introduction: There are significant resource challenges to burn surgical care delivery in low and middle-income countries at baseline and only a few burn cost analysis studies from sub-Saharan Africa have been performed. Methods: This is a retrospective database analysis of prospectively collected data from all patients recorded in the burn registry between June 2011 and August 2014 located at the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Unit in Lilongwe, Malawi. We utilized activity-based costing, a bottom-up cost analysis methodology with cost allocation that allows determination of unit cost or cost per service. Results: 905 patients were admitted to the burn unit during the study period. The calculated total monthly burn expenditure for all cost centers was $11,622.66. Per day, the total unit cost was $387.42 with a mean daily per-patient cost of $24.26 (SD +/- $6.44). Consequently, the mean cost per in-patient admission was $559.85 (SD +/- $736.17). The mean daily cost per 1% total burn surface per patient at our center is $2.65 (SD +/- $3.01). Discussion: This burn care cost analysis study helps quantify the relative contribution of differing cost centers that comprise burn care delivery and hospital costs in a sub-Saharan African setting. Accurate and relevant cost information on hospital services at the patient level is therefore fundamental for policy makers, payers, and hospitals. Conclusion: Our study has demonstrated that comprehensive burn care is possible at a cost much lower than found in other burn centers in low or middle-income countries and can be sustained with moderate funding.

Timing of early excision and grafting following burn in sub-Saharan Africa,"Gallaher, J. R.; Mjuweni, S.; Shah, M.; Cairns, B. A.; Charles, A. G.","BACKGROUND: This study sought to establish appropriate timing of burn wound excision and grafting in a resource-poor setting in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: All burn patients (905 patients) admitted to Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) Burn Unit in Lilongwe, Malawi over three years (2011-2014) were studied. RESULTS: 275 patients (30%) had an operation during their admission. In patients who received an operation, median age was 5 years (IQR, 2.7-19) and median total body surface area burn was 15% (IQR, 8-25). 91 patients (33%) had early excision (≤5 days) and 184 patients (67%) had late excision (>5 days). Mortality was significantly greater in the early group (25.3% vs. 9.2%, p=0.001). Controlling for total body surface area burn and age, the adjusted predictive probability of mortality were 0.256 (CI 0.159-0.385) and 0.107 (CI 0.062-0.177) if operated ≤5 and >5 days, respectively (p=0.0114). The odds ratio for mortality if operated >5 days is 0.34 (CI 0.15-0.79, p<0.000).

Essential surgery at the district hospital: A retrospective descriptive analysis in three african countries,"Galukande, M.; von Schreeb, J.; Wladis, A.; Mbembati, N.; de Miranda, H.; Kruk, M.

B.","Background Surgical conditions contribute significantly to the disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there is an apparent neglect of surgical care as a public health intervention to counter this burden. There is increasing enthusiasm to reverse this trend, by promoting essential surgical services at the district hospital, the first point of contact for critical conditions for rural populations. This study investigated the scope of surgery conducted at district hospitals in three sub-Saharan African countries. Methods and Findings In a retrospective descriptive study, field data were collected from eight district hospitals in Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique using a standardized form and interviews with key informants. Overall, the scope of surgical procedures performed was narrow and included mainly essential and life-saving emergency procedures. Surgical output varied across hospitals from five to 45 major procedures/10,000 people. Obstetric operations were most common and included cesarean sections and uterine evacuations. Hernia repair and wound care accounted for 65% of general surgical procedures. The number of beds in the studied hospitals ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 per 1,000 population. Conclusion The findings of this study clearly indicate low levels of surgical care provision at the district level for the hospitals studied. The extent to which this translates into unmet need remains unknown although the very low proportions of live births in the catchment areas of these eight hospitals that are born by cesarean section suggest that there is a substantial unmet need for surgical services. The district hospital in the current health system in sub-Saharan Africa lends itself to feasible integration of essential surgery into the spectrum of comprehensive primary care services. It is therefore critical that the surgical capacity of the district hospital is significantly expanded; this will result in sustainable preventable morbidity and mortality. © 2010 Galukande et al.",2010,,PLoS Medicine,7,3,1-10,,10.1371/journal.pmed.1000243,21877,#3127,Galukande 2010,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-04 04:42:30)(Select): interesting paper/good insights. certainly useful; Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-04 04:41:00)(Select): surgical capacity ; barriers

Surgical complications and subsequent revision surgeries among noma cases treated in Ethiopia,"Gebretsadik, H. G.","Introduction: Noma, an overlooked infectious disease, inflicts severe facial tissue damage, posing substantial challenges in patient care. This study delves into surgical complications and subsequent revision surgeries among noma cases treated in Ethiopia. Materials and Methods: The research employed a cross-sectional retrospective review of medical records treated between 2007 and 2019 retrieved from the Facing Africa database. Results: The review encompasses 235 noma cases. Twenty-four cases (19 females and 5 males) experienced various complications, predominately major complications leading to subsequent revision surgeries. The identified complications included flap necrosis, abscess formation, tenderness, graft site infection, flap bulking, dental misalignment, corner of the mouth dehiscence, infected bone and plate, flap malpositioning, restricted mouth opening with ankylosis, neuropathic pain, recurrent flap infection, and offensive odor. Revision surgeries included wound cleansing, abscess drainage, skin graft removal, exploratory surgery, wound care, debulking, scar removal, debridement, trismus release, commisuroplasty, and flap repositioning. Conclusion: These findings illuminate the intricacies of noma surgery in Ethiopia, emphasizing the importance of understanding the nature and frequency of complications for optimizing treatment outcomes. Insights from this study can guide healthcare providers, especially novice surgeons, and policymakers, in refining surgical interventions and enhancing outcomes for noma patients.

B.; Dalla Gasperina, D.","Background: Little is known about the surgical conditions affecting the pediatric population in low-income countries. In this article we describe the epidemiology of pediatric surgical diseases observed in Mutoyi hospital, a first-level hospital in Burundi. Methods and Findings: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all children (0–14 years) admitted to the Surgery ward from January 2017 to December 2017. We also reviewed the records of all the patients admitted to the Neonatology ward in 2017 and among them we selected the ones in which a surgical diagnosis was present. Five hundred twenty-eight children were admitted to the surgical ward during the study period. The most common conditions requiring hospitalization were abscesses (29.09%), fractures (13.59%), osteomyelitis (9.76%), burns (5.40%) and head injuries (4.36%). The average length of stay was 16 days. Fifty-six newborns were admitted to the Neonatology ward for a surgical condition; 29% of them had an abscess. Conclusions: Conditions requiring surgical care are frequent in Burundian children and have a completely different spectrum from the western ones. This is due on one side to an under-diagnosis of certain conditions caused by the lack of diagnostic tools and on the other to the living conditions of the population. This difference should lead to intervention plans tailored on the actual necessities of the country and not on the western ones.",2021,,Frontiers in Pediatrics,9,,,,10.3389/fped.2021.681478,17403,#3336,Gortan 2021,"",""
Cost/DALY averted in a small hospital in Sierra Leone: what is the relative contribution of different services?,"Gosselin, R. A.; Thind, A.; Bellardinelli, A.","BACKGROUND: A cost-effective analysis (CEA) can be a useful tool to guide resource allocation decisions. However, there is a dearth of evidence on the cost/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted by health facilities in the developing world. METHODS: We conducted a study to calculate the costs and the DALYs averted by an entire hospital in Sierra Leone, using the method suggested by McCord and Chowdhury (Int J Gynaecol Obstet 2003;81:83-92). RESULTS: For the 3-month study period, total costs were calculated to be dollar 369,774. Using the approach of McCord and Chowdhury, we calculated that 11,282 DALYs were averted during the study period, resulting in a cost/DALY averted of dollar 32.78. This figure compares favorably to other non-surgical health interventions in developing countries. We found that while surgery accounts for 63% of total caseload, it contributes to 38% of the total DALYs averted. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of some common pathologies in developing countries may be more cost-effective than previously thought, and our results provide evidence for the inclusion of surgery as part of the basic public health armamentarium in developing countries. However, these results are highly context-specific, and more research is needed from developing countries to further refine the methodology and analysis.",2006,,World J Surg,30,4,505-11,16528459,10.1007/s00268-005-0609-5,14212,#3341,Gosselin 2006,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-31 01:30:31)(Select): PRresents the costs averted when a condition is managed.

Recent global children's surgical guidelines suggest training and support of general surgeons in rural regional hospitals as an effective approach to increasing pediatric surgical capacity. METHODS: Two years of a prospective clinical database of children's surgery admissions at 2 regional referral hospitals in Uganda were reviewed. Primary outcomes included case volume and clinical outcomes of children at each hospital. Additionally, the disability-adjusted life-years averted by delivery of pediatric surgical services at these hospitals were calculated. Using a value of statistical life calculation, we also estimated the economic benefit of the pediatric surgical care currently being delivered. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, more than 300 surgical procedures were performed at each hospital per year. The majority of cases were standard general surgery cases including hernia repairs and intussusception as well as procedures for surgical infections and trauma. In-hospital mortality was 2.4% in Soroti and 1% in Lacor. Pediatric surgical capacity at these hospitals resulted in over 12,400 disability-adjusted life-years averted/year. This represents an estimated economic benefit of 10.2 million US dollars/year to the Ugandan society. CONCLUSION: This investigation demonstrates that lifesaving pediatric procedures are safely performed by general surgeons in Uganda. General surgeons who perform pediatric surgery significantly increase surgical access to rural regions of the country and add a large economic benefit to Ugandan society.

Burden of emergency pediatric surgical procedures on surgical capacity in Uganda: a new metric for health system performance,"Grabski, D. F.; Kakembo, N.; Situma, M.; Cheung, M.; Shikanda, A.; Okello, I.; Kisa, P.; Muzira, A.; Sekabira, J.; Ozgediz, D.","BACKGROUND: The significant burden of emergency operations in low- and middle-income countries can overwhelm surgical capacity leading to a backlog of elective surgical cases. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the burden of emergency procedures on pediatric surgical capacity in Uganda and to determine health metrics that capture surgical backlog and effective coverage of children's surgical disease in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We reviewed 2 independent and prospectively collected databases on pediatric surgical admissions at Mulago National Referral Hospital and Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda. Pediatric surgical patients admitted at either hospital between October 2015 to June 2017 were included. Our primary outcome was the distribution of surgical acuity and associated mortality. RESULTS: A combined total of 1,930 patients were treated at the two hospitals, and 1,110 surgical procedures were performed. There were 571 emergency cases (51.6%), 108 urgent cases (9.7%), and 429 elective cases (38.6%). Overall mortality correlated with surgical acuity. Emergency intestinal diversions for colorectal congenital malformations (anorectal malformations and Hirschsprung's disease) to elective definitive repair was 3:1. Additionally, 30% of inguinal hernias were incarcerated or strangulated at time of repair. CONCLUSION: Emergency and urgent operations utilize the majority of operative resources for pediatric surgery groups in low- and middle-income countries, leading to a backlog of complex congenital procedures. We propose the ratio of emergency diversion to elective repair of colorectal congenital malformations and the ratio of emergency to elective repair of inguinal hernias as effective health metrics to track this backlog.

Systematic review of met and unmet need of surgical disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa,"Grimes, C. E.; Law, R. S.; Borgstein, E. S.; Mkandawire, N. C.; Lavy, C. B.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the burden of surgical disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa, where district and rural hospitals are the main providers of care. The present study sought to analyze what is known about the met and unmet need of surgical disease. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of surveys in rural areas, information on surgical admissions, and operations performed within rural and district hospitals. Data were extrapolated to calculate the amount of surgical disease per 100,000 population and the number of operations performed per 100,000 population. These extrapolations were used to estimate the total, the met, and the unmet need of surgical disease. RESULTS: The estimated overall incidence of nonfatal injury is at least 1,690/100,000 population per year. Morbidity as a result of injury is up to 190/100,000 population per year, and the annual mortality from injury is 53-92/100,000. District hospitals perform 6 fracture reductions (95% CI: 0.1-12)/100,000 population per year and 14 laparotomies (95% CI: 7-21)/100,000 per year. The incidence of peritonitis and bowel obstruction is unknown, although it may be as high as 1,364/100,000 population for the acute abdomen. The annual total need for inguinal hernia repair is estimated to be a minimum of 205/100,000 population. The average district hospital performs 30 hernia repairs (95% CI: 18-41)/100,000 population per year, leaving an unmet need of 175/100,000 population annually.

Macroeconomic costs of the unmet burden of surgical disease in Sierra Leone: a retrospective economic analysis,"Grimes, C. E.; Quaife, M.; Kamara, T. B.; Lavy, C. B. D.; Leather, A. J. M.; Bolkan, H. A.","OBJECTIVES: The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery estimated that low/middle-income countries will lose an estimated cumulative loss of US$12.3 trillion from gross domestic product (GDP) due to the unmet burden of surgical disease. However, no country-specific data currently exist. We aimed to estimate the costs to the Sierra Leone economy from death and disability which may have been averted by surgical care. DESIGN: We used estimates of total, met and unmet need from two main sources-a cluster randomised, cross-sectional, countrywide survey and a retrospective, nationwide study on surgery in Sierra Leone. We calculated estimated disability-adjusted life years from morbidity and mortality for the estimated unmet burden and modelled the likely economic impact using three different methods-gross national income per capita, lifetime earnings foregone and value of a statistical life. RESULTS: In 2012, estimated, discounted lifetime losses to the Sierra Leone economy from the unmet burden of surgical disease was between US$1.1 and US$3.8 billion, depending on the economic method used. These lifetime losses equate to between 23% and 100% of the annual GDP for Sierra Leone. 80% of economic losses were due to mortality. The incremental losses averted by scale up of surgical provision to the Lancet Commission target of 80% were calculated to be between US$360 million and US$2.9 billion. CONCLUSION: There is a large economic loss from the unmet need for surgical care in Sierra Leone.

The Effect of a Surgery Residency Program and Enhanced Educational Activities on Trauma Mortality in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Grudziak, J.; Gallaher, J.; Banza, L.; Cairns, B.; Varela, C.; Young, S.; Charles, A.","INTRODUCTION: To address the need for more surgical providers in low-resource settings, a collaboration to create a surgical residency-training program for local Malawian physicians was established in 2009. This study sought to describe the short-term independent effect of a surgical residency program on trauma mortality at a tertiary trauma center in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients recorded in the trauma surveillance registry of Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi, from 2009 (three residents) through 2014 (11 residents). Log-binominal regression modeling was used to compare the risk ratio of death compared to the referent year of 2009, when the program was started, after adjusting for relevant covariates. Primary injury type was used as a surrogate for injury severity. RESULTS: In total, 82,534 patients were recorded into the KCH Trauma Registry during the study period. Mean age was 23.1 years (SD 15.7) with a male preponderance (72.1%). Trauma patient volume increased from 8725 patients in 2009 to 15,998 patients in 2014. Each year had a significantly decreased risk of death compared to 2009 when adjusted for primary injury type, age, and gender, with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.73 (95% CI 0.58, 0.90) in 2010 and 0.52 (95% CI 0.43, 0.62) in 2014. CONCLUSION: The global burden of surgical diseases cannot be attenuated in the presence of an inadequate surgical workforce.

The impact and cost-effectiveness of the Amref Health Africa-Smile Train Cleft Lip and Palate Surgical Repair Programme in Eastern and Central Africa,"Hamze, H.; Mengiste, A.; Carter, J.","INTRODUCTION: Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) is a congenital malformation that causes significant morbidity in low and middle income countries. Amref Health Africa has partnered with Smile Train to provide CLP surgeries since 2006. METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data of 37,274 CLP patients from the Smile Train database operated on in eastern and central Africa between 2006 and 2014. Cases were analyzed by age, gender, country and surgery type. The impact of cleft surgery was determined by measuring averted Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and delayed averted DALYs. We used mean Smile Train costs to calculate cost-effectiveness. We calculated economic benefit using the human capital approach and Value of Statistical Life (VSL) methods. RESULTS: The median age at time of primary surgery was 5.4 years. A total of 207,879 DALYs were averted at a total estimated cost of US$13 million. Mean averted DALYs per patient were 5.6, and mean cost per averted DALY was $62.8. Total delayed burden of disease from late age at surgery was 36,352 DALYs. Surgical correction resulted in $292 million in economic gain using the human capital approach and $2.4 billion using VSL methods.

Methods: This is a pre-post cohort study, conducted in a referral hospital in Tanzania. Patients who underwent burn scar contracture release surgery in 2017-2018 were eligible. ROM (goniometry), disability (WHODAS 2.0) and QoL (EQ-5D) were assessed. The ROM data were compared to the ROM that is required to perform activities of daily living without compensation, i.e. functional ROM. Assessments were performed preoperatively and at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Results: In total, 44 patients underwent surgery on 115 affected joints. At 12 months, the follow-up rate was 86%. The mean preoperative ROM was 37.3% of functional ROM (SD 31.2). This improved up to 108.7% at 12 months postoperatively (SD 42.0, p < 0.001).

There was no anaesthetic morbidity or mortality and no immediate perioperative morbidity. Two cleft lip repairs developed partial wound dehiscence and there was one palatal fistula. Five local surgeons underwent cleft training. All centres participating in this project requested further visits. The total cost for each cleft repair was 27 pounds sterling.

Plastic and reconstructive surgery in Uganda--10 years experience,"Hodges, S.; Wilson, J.; Hodges, A.","We describe our experience of working in plastic and reconstructive surgery in Uganda over the last 10 years. There is a high burden of disease, a health system that is under resourced, and few qualified physicians to provide healthcare for a principally rural population. Training the physicians of the future is essential. Prevention and early wound management needs to be emphasized for traumatic injuries including burns. Subsidized up-country visits by trained specialists with the appropriate equipment are required to provide a service for the rural poor. There appears to be a high mortality rate in babies with unrepaired cleft palate, probably due to feeding difficulties in an environment where intercurrent illness is common. We now offer nutritional support with early combined cleft lip and palate repair in these babies, a practice that has a high success rate and may be suited to other specialist units in the developing world.",2009,,Paediatr Anaesth,19,1,12-8,19076496,10.1111/j.1460-9592.2008.02839.x,13328,#3712,Hodges 2009,"",Burden
Barriers to Performing Soft Tissue Reconstruction Procedures among Orthopedic Surgeons in Low- and Middle-income Countries: Results of a Surgical Skills Training Course,"Holler, J. T.; Albright, P.; Challa, S.; Ali, S. H.; Martins, D.; Keys, K.; Shearer, D. W.; Terry, M. J.","Background: Appropriate management of soft tissue injury associated with orthopedic trauma is challenging in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) due to the lack of available reconstructive surgeons. The Surgical Management and Reconstructive Training (SMART) course teaches orthopedic surgeons reconstructive techniques aimed at improving soft tissue management. This study aims to identify additional barriers to implementing these techniques for surgeons in LMICs who have attended SMART courses. Methods: This is a mixed-methods study including a Likert-scale-based survey administered to 150 surgeons from LMICs attending the 2018 SMART courses in Tanzania and San Francisco and key informant interviews with 20 surgeons who perform soft tissue coverage procedures. Results: In surveys, respondents reported inadequate local plastic surgeon availability for lower extremity fracture requiring muscle flaps (88%). Surgeons agreed that flap surgeries are important for patients with significant soft tissue injury following open fractures (97%). They reported inadequate access to instruments, such as dermatomes (59%) and Humby knives (32%), and senior-level support (31%). Fewer than half of surgeons with flap experience (n = 85) felt confident in training peers (45%). In interviews, delays in returning patients to operating rooms were frequently cited as a barrier (90%). Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that soft tissue procedures are perceived as a high priority among orthopedic surgeons, but there are multiple barriers, including a lack of plastic surgeons, and many modifiable barriers including a lack of surgical equipment, peer training, and senior colleague support.",2019,,Prs-Glob.

J.","Background: Managing lower extremity fractures complicated by large soft-tissue defects is challenging for surgeons in low- and middle-income countries, and long-term quality of life (QOL) for these patients is unclear. Methods: We examined QOL, surgical complications, and longitudinal outcomes in 10 patients with Gustilo-Anderson Classification Type IIIB open tibia fractures seen at an orthopedic institute in Tanzania, from December 2015 to March 2017. Patients completed follow-up at 2-, 6-, 12-, 26-, and 52-week time points, and returned for qualitative interviews at 2.5 years. The primary outcome was QOL, as measured using EuroQoL-5D scores and qualitative semi-structured interview responses. The secondary outcome was rate of complication, as defined by reoperation for deep infection or nonunion. Results: Ten patients enrolled in the study and 7 completed 1-year follow-up. All fractures were caused by road traffic accidents and treated by external fixation. No patients received initial soft-tissue (flap) coverage of the wound. All patients developed an infected nonunion. No patients returned to work at 6 weeks, 3 months, or 6 months. EQ-5D index scores at 1 year were poor (0.71 +/- 0.09). Interview themes included ongoing medical complications, loss of employment, reduced income, and difficulty with activities of daily living. Conclusions: Patients in low- and middle-income countries with IIIB open tibia fractures not treated with appropriate soft-tissue coverage experience poor QOL, high complication rates, and severe socioeconomic effects as a result of their injuries.

"Creating an Outpatient, Local Anesthetic Hand Operating Room in a Resource-Constrained Ghanaian Hospital Builds Surgical Capacity and Financial Stability","Holoyda, K. A.; Farhat, B.; Lalonde, D. H.; Owusu-Danso, O.; Agbenorku, P.; Hoyte-Williams, P. E.; Rockwell, W. B.","INTRODUCTION: Expanding surgical capacity is very difficult in resource-constrained countries. Financial input and additional physical operating room space are needed. The surgical patient volume exists, but the lack of operating room time causes postponement of cases. Hand surgery is particularly important as it improves patient function and allows for a timely return to the workforce after injury. Some hand surgery cases may be performed under local anesthesia with a very basic instrument set in a procedure room. This arrangement eliminates the need and financial burden of an equipped operating room and the need for an anesthesiologist. We hypothesized that performing hand surgery in a simple procedure room by a surgeon with knowledge of adequate local anesthesia could increase hand surgery capacity significantly in a low-income country. METHODS: This technique has been instituted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, with the use of a single procedure room that was previously used for storage. A surgeon trained in performing wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet technique visited Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and provided lectures about hand surgery under local anesthesia and evidence-based sterility for 6 years. The number and type of cases performed in the procedure room were recorded for the first 11 months after it opened in 2017. RESULTS: For 11 months, use of this room had increased surgical capacity by 33 cases per month. Patient ages ranged from 2 months to 65 years. There have been 358 total cases performed, 240 of which were hand cases. This included washout of hand wounds (n = 87), tendon repair (n = 54) including a single tendon transfer, fracture pinning (n = 33), amputations (n = 24), trigger finger repair (n = 10), nerve repair (n = 6), congenital hand surgery (n = 4), and other (n = 22). Cost savings per case in the procedure room ranges from 500 cedis (US $100) to 2000 cedis (US $400). CONCLUSIONS: The simple procedure room runs more efficiently and is less costly compared with the main operating rooms. Although the case volume has increased surgical capacity significantly, costs to the hospital and patient have decreased. The hospital is reimbursed in a timely fashion for the procedures directly by the patient using this technique. The creation of a single procedure room for wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet hand surgery has helped address the issues of inadequate operating room space, time, and expense in resource-constrained Ghana.",2020,,Ann Plast Surg,84,4,385-389,32118629,10.1097/sap.0000000000002196,14360,#3734,Holoyda 2020,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-20 23:36:05)(Select): Doctors were trained to carry out surgeries, which improved surgical capacity; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-20 23:35:16)(Select): Congenital conditions were managed with reconstructive surgery; ",Access to Healthcare; Anesthesia; Barriers to Care; Surgical Capacity

D.; Fourie, L.; Demisse, Y.; Befikadu, S.; McGurk, M.","Around the world there is a small industry of non-governmental organisations that provide health care in niche areas that cannot be met by national health care provision. One topic is facial deformity that can have a dramatic effect on quality of life. In this study we investigate the morbidity and outcome of a British surgical team working for a 2-week period in Ethiopia. Thirty-five patients who presented with facial deformities had 47 operations during a 2-week period. Data were recorded for a minimum of 3 weeks postoperatively. Operative techniques were classified as simple or complex. Postoperative complications were assessed and classified as major, intermediate, and minor. In addition, the character of each complication was recorded and the cause elucidated. After 3 weeks the clinical objectives had been achieved in 14/17 who had simple procedures but in only 5/18 who had complex operations (p = 0.004). We conclude that complex procedures are technically possible within an under-privileged health care system but successful outcome depends on paying attention to multiple factors in patients' care and wound management.

L.","Background: People with albinism (PWA) are at increased risk of photodamage and skin cancer. In many parts of Africa, there is a significant lack of knowledge regarding albinism which can lead to societal stigma, discrimination, and persecution from an early age. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), there is limited clinical data on PWA and skin cancer. We aim to better understand sociodemographics, risk factors, clinical features, and outcomes of this population. Methods: Patients with a diagnosis of albinism and skin cancer presenting to Kisangani Albino Clinic were enrolled. Results: Of 205 PWA, 61 patients were diagnosed with skin cancer with a mean age of 26.5 years. Common occupations were student (45.6%) or unemployed (26.4%). Discrimination was experienced from close contacts (24.4%) and society (67.4%). A majority (88.5%) had never used sunscreen, only 4.9% used fully sun protective clothing, and 90.2% spent 4 or more hours in the sun daily. Skin cancers had a mean size of 3.8 cm and were most commonly located on the face (47.7%). Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common histopathological diagnosis. Most patients underwent excision, and 90.2% had clinical clearance of tumors at a mean follow-up of 5.7 months. Conclusion: People living with albinism in the DRC experience a high rate of nonmelanoma skin cancers at a young age and additionally face a number of psychosocial challenges.

Management of chronic wounds based on evidence-based practice requires baseline data for adequate planning. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to determine the point prevalence of chronic wounds in a tertiary hospital (University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria) and utilize this information for subsequent wound care planning. METHODS: The study was carried out within a 1-month period and included all patients seen in the hospital with chronic wounds. The data obtained was entered into a designed form and was subsequently analyzed. RESULTS: There were 48 patients with 78 wounds representing approximately 11% of patients seen in the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgery each month. Their ages ranged from 3 months to 80 years; the median age was 48 years. The male to female ratio was 1.6 to 1. The duration of the wounds ranged from 6 weeks to 780 weeks; the median duration of the wounds was 10 weeks. The area of the wounds ranged from 1 cm(2) -1,248 cm(2) (median 24 cm(2)). The most common chronic wounds were diabetic wounds, followed by pressure ulcers, postinfection ulcers, posttraumatic ulcers, burn wounds, malignant ulcers, and venous ulcers.

The exact prevalence is difficult to assess due to insufficient data, different study designs, and deferent study definitions of chronic wounds. There is limited data on the prevalence and the burden of chronic wound in our subregion. This study was therefore carried out to establish the burden of chronic wound in order to document a baseline data for monitoring progress, as well as provide information for advocacy on equitable distribution of resources for wound care. Method: This was a retrospective review between January 2007 and December 2022. Data was analysed using SPSS. Result: A total of 866 patients with new chronic wounds were seen at an average of 54 cases per year. An average of 330 old and new chronic wounds are seen yearly. Chronic ulcers are developing at a rate of 1.2/1000 population, and the prevalence of chronic ulcer is 3.3/1000 population. Most patients were males (57.2 %), with a mean age of 41.7years ± 20.6.

Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in Zambia: Epidemiology of 16 Years of Practice,"Jovic, G.; Corlew, D.; Bowman, K. G.","The epidemiology of surgical conditions in developing countries is not well studied, but plastic and reconstructive surgery can play a significant role in meeting the need for surgical care. Knowledge of the conditions treated by a plastic surgeon in a low-income country would inform the development of surgical services. The surgical log of the lead author from 1993 to 2008 was reviewed. The cases were performed in 33 surgical facilities in Zambia, and name, gender, age, diagnosis, procedure, and hospital were prospectively recorded. Data were analyzed for the number and distribution of cases and for patterns related to age and gender. Between 1993 and 2008, 5,740 operations were performed, and complete data were available for 5,735 (99.9%) patients. There were 5,774 surgical diagnoses.

We aimed to create a prospective trauma registry to expand the data elements collected on injury at a busy tertiary center in Yaoundé Cameroon. METHODS: Details of the injury context, presentation, care, cost, and disposition from the emergency department (ED) were gathered over a 6-month period, by trained research assistants using a structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate models were built to explore variable relationships and outcomes. RESULTS: There were 2,855 injured patients in 6 months, comprising almost half of all ED visits. Mean age was 30 years; 73 % were male. Injury mechanism was road traffic injury in 59 %, fall in 7 %, penetrating trauma in 6 %, and animal bites in 4 %. Of these, 1,974 (69 %) were discharged home, 517 (18 %) taken to the operating room, and 14 (1 %) to the intensive care unit. The body areas most severely injured were pelvis and extremity in 43 %, head in 30 %, chest in 4 %, and abdomen in 3 %.

W.; Kanmounye, U. S.","Background Conditions amenable to surgical, obstetric, trauma, and anaesthesia (SOTA) care are a major contributor to death and disability in Ghana. SOTA care is an essential component of a well-functioning health system, and better understanding of the state of SOTA care in Ghana is necessary to design policies to address gaps in SOTA care delivery. Objective The aim of this study is to assess the current situation of SOTA care in Ghana. Methods A situation analysis was conducted as a narrative review of published scientific literature. Information was extracted from studies according to five health system domains related to SOTA care: service delivery, workforce, infrastructure, finance, and information management. Results Ghanaians face numerous barriers to accessing quality SOTA care, primarily due to health system inadequacies. Over 77% of surgical operations performed in Ghana are essential procedures, most of which are performed at district-level hospitals that do not have consistent access to imaging and operative room fundamentals. Tertiary facilities have consistent access to these modalities but lack consistent access to oxygen and/or oxygen concentrators on-site as well as surgical supplies and anaesthetic medicines. Ghanaian patients cover up to 91% of direct SOTA costs out-of-pocket, while health insurance only covers up to 14% of the costs. The Ghanaian surgical system also faces severe workforce inadequacies especially in district-level facilities. Most specialty surgeons are concentrated in urban areas. Ghana's health system lacks a solid information management foundation as it does not have centralized SOTA databases, leading to incomplete, poorly coded, and illegible patient information. Conclusion This review establishes that surgical services provided in Ghana are focused primarily on district-level facilities that lack adequate infrastructure and face workforce shortages, among other challenges. A comprehensive scale-up of Ghana's surgical infrastructure, workforce, national insurance plan, and information systems is warranted to improve Ghana's surgical system.",2022,,Glob.

A prospective analysis of pinch grafting of chronic leg ulcers in a series of elderly patients in rural Cameroon,"Kadia, B. M.; Dimala, C. A.; Aroke, D.; Ekabe, C. J.; Kadia, R. S. M.; Mefire, A. C.","Background: Chronic leg ulcers (CLUs) pose serious public health concerns worldwide. They mainly affect the elderly population. Pinch grafting (PG) could be used to treat a variety of CLUs. However, in Cameroon, there is scarce data on the outcome of PG of CLUs in elderly patients in rural hospitals where most of these patients seek for medical attention and where clinicians rely on unconventional wound dressing methods to treat CLUs. Our objective was to describe the outcome of PG of CLUs in elderly patients in rural Cameroon. Methods: This was a prospective study conducted in a rural hospital of North West Cameroon. From February 2015 to January 2016, comprehensive historical and clinical data were collected per elderly patient who presented with a chronic leg ulcer necessitating PG. PG was done using a simple procedure and each patient followed up for 8months. Outcome was described in terms of ulcer healing and pain and donor site complications. Results: Our series included 13 patients: 8 males (61.54%; 95% CI: 31.58-86.14) and 5 females (38.46%; 95% CI: 13.86-68.42) aged from 69 to 88years (mean: 77.54±5.70years). Three patients (23.08%; 95% CI: 5.04-53.81) had associated co-morbidities. All the ulcers were unilateral with durations ranging from 7 to 41months (mean: 19.46±11.03months). The ulcers ranged in size from 9.0 to 38.1cm2 (mean: 17.66±8.35cm 2). We registered one (7.69%; 95% CI: 0.19-36.03) graft rejection. Concerning the other ulcers, ten (83.33%; 95% CI: 51.59-97.91) had healed after 12 postoperative weeks while 2 (16.67%; 95% CI: 2.09%-48.41) had healed after 14 postoperative weeks and the mean healing time was 12.33±0.78weeks. Patients with healed ulcers had reduced ulcer site pain from the immediate postoperative period but there was no significant difference in the mean pain scores before and after graft (6.77 against 4.23, p=0.13). These ulcers remained healed after 8 postoperative months. Each donor site had healed 2weeks after PG. Donor site problems were minimal and included hypopigmentation.

N.; Sekabira, J.; Ozgediz, D.","INTRODUCTION: Children's surgical access in low and low-middle income countries is severely limited. Investigations detailing met and unmet surgical access are necessary to inform appropriate resource allocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical volume, outcomes, and distribution of pediatric general surgical procedures were analyzed using prospective pediatric surgical databases from four separate regional hospitals in Uganda. The current averted burden of surgical disease through pediatric surgical delivery in Uganda and the unmet surgical need based on estimates from high-income country data was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 8514 patients were treated at the four hospitals over a 6-year period corresponding to 1350 pediatric surgical cases per year in Uganda or six surgical cases per 100,000 children per year. The majority of complex congenital anomalies and surgical oncology cases were performed at Mulago and Mbarara Hospitals, which have dedicated pediatric surgical teams (P < 0.0001). The averted burden of pediatric surgical disease was 27,000 disability adjusted life years per year, which resulted in an economic benefit of approximately 23 million USD per year. However, the average case volume performed at the four regional hospitals currently represents 1% of the total projected pediatric surgical need. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation is one of the first to demonstrate the distribution of pediatric surgical procedures at a country level through the use of a prospective locally created database. Significant disease burden was averted by local pediatric and adult surgical teams, demonstrating the economic benefit of pediatric surgical care delivery.

Surgical Repair of Orofacial Clefts in North Kivu Province of Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC),"Kalisya, L. M.; Bake, J. F.; Elisee, B.; Nyavandu, K.; Perry, R.; Rothstein, D. H.; Cairo, S. B.","BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of orofacial clefts in low- and middle-income countries with significant unmet need, despite having 50% of the population younger than 18 years in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The purpose of this article is to report on the experience of general surgeons with orofacial clefts at a single institution. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients treated for cleft lip/palate in the province of North Kivu, DRC between 2008 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 1112 procedures (122/year) were performed. All procedures were performed by general surgeons following training by an international nongovernmental aid organization. A total of 59.2% of patients were male and the median age was 3.4 years (interquartile range: 0.7-13 years). Average distance from surgical center to patient location was 242.6 km (range: 2-1375 km) with outreach performed for distances >200 kms. A majority (82.1%) of patients received general anesthesia (GA) with significant differences in use of GA, age, weight, and length of stay by major orofacial cleft category. Of the 1112 patients, 86.1% were reported to have cleft lip alone, 10.5% had cleft lip and palate, and 3.4% cleft palate alone. Despite this, only 5.3% of patients underwent surgical repair of cleft palate. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors including malnutrition, risk of bleeding, procedural complexity, and cosmetic results may contribute to the distribution of procedures performed where most cleft palates are not treated.

Patterns of congenital malformations and barriers to care in eastern democratic republic of congo,"Kalisya, L. M.; Nyavandu, K.; Machumu, B.; Kwiratuwe, S.; Rej, P. H.","An increase of congenital anomalies in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been reported. Congenital malformations (CMs) are not uncommon among newborns and, if left untreated, can contribute to increased neonate morbidity and mortality. Methods Medical records of all individuals admitted with a diagnosed CM to HEAL Africa Teaching Hospital (Goma, DRC) from 2002 to 2014 (n=1301) were reviewed. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics to summarize chart records, and inferential statistics to investigate significant barriers to earlier treatment. Results Since 2012, the number of patients treated each year for CMs has increased by over 200% compared to the average annual number of cases treated from 2002-2011. Though delayed presentation of patients to HEAL Hospital was very obvious, with an average age of 8.2 years. We find that patient age has been significantly decreasing (p=0.037) over time. The average distance separating patients from HEAL Hospital was 178 km, with approximately one third living 350 km or further from the treatment center. Distance is the most significant (p=3.33x10<sup>-6</sup> ) barrier to earlier treatment. When controlling for an interaction between gender and the use of mercy funds, we also find that female patients are at a significant (p=1.04x10<sup>-3</sup> ) disadvantage to undergo earlier corrective surgery. This disadvantage is further illustrated by our finding that 89% of women and girls, and over 81% of all patients, required mercy funds to cover the cost of surgery in 2014. Lastly, the mortality rate for surgery was low and averaged less than 1.0%. Conclusion Despite a formal end to the war in 2009, and an overall increase in individuals undergoing corrective surgery, distance, poverty, and gender are still massive barriers to CM care at HEAL Hospital, Goma, DRC. We find that patients have been successfully treated earlier by HEAL, although the average age of CM correction in 2014 (4.9 years) is still above average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, we advocate for further funding from the National Government and international health agencies to enable continued treatment of CMs in rural residents of the eastern DRC. Distance, the most significant barrier to care can be mitigated by the implementation of additional mobile clinics and the construction of regional surgery centers along with the associated hiring of surgeons trained in CM repair.",2015,,PLoS ONE,10,7,,,10.1371/journal.pone.0132362,20215,#4171,Kalisya 2015,"",Barriers to Care; Congenital Malformations

H.; Staton, C. A.","Introduction: Pediatric injuries in low- and middle-income countries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Implementing hospital-based trauma registries can reduce the knowledge gap in both hospital care and patient outcomes and lead to quality improvement initiatives. The goal of this study was to create a pediatric trauma registry to provide insight into the epidemiology, outcomes, and factors associated with poor outcomes in injured children. Methods: This was a prospective observational study in which a pediatric trauma registry was implemented at a large zonal referral hospital in Northern Tanzania. Data included demographics, hospital-based care, and outcomes including morbidity and mortality. Data were input into REDCap© and analyzed using ANOVA and Chi-squared tests in SAS(Version 9.4)©. Results: 365 patients were enrolled in the registry from November 2020 to October 2021. The majority were males (n=240, 65.8%). Most were children 0–5 years (41.7%, n=152), 34.5% (n=126) were 6–11 years, and 23.8% (n=87) were 12–17 years. The leading causes of pediatric injuries were falls (n=137, 37.5%) and road traffic injuries (n=125, 34.5%). The mortality rate was 8.2% (n=30). Of the in-hospital deaths, 43.3% were children with burn injuries who also had a higher odds of mortality than children with other injuries (OR 8.72, p<0.001). The factors associated with in-hospital mortality and morbidity were vital sign abnormalities, burn severity, abnormal Glasgow Coma Score, and ICU admission. Conclusion: The mortality rate of injured children in our cohort was high, especially in children with burn injuries. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality, interventions should be prioritized that focus on pediatric injured patients that present with abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, and severe burns.

"Prevalence, pattern and perceptions of cleft lip and cleft palate among children born in two hospitals in Kisoro District, Uganda","Kesande, T.; Muwazi, L. M.; Bataringaya, A.; Rwenyonyi, C. M.","BACKGROUND: Cleft lip with or without cleft palate is one of the most common congenital anomalies that affect the oro-facial region. The aim of the study was to determine the period prevalence, pattern and perceptions of cleft lip and cleft palate in children born between 2005 and 2010 in two hospitals in Kisoro District, Uganda. METHODS: The study involved a retrospective review of medical records of mothers who delivered live babies between January 2005 and December 2010 in Kisoro Hospital and St. Francis Hospital, Mutolere in Kisoro District. Key informant interviews of mothers (n = 20) of the children with cleft lip and/or clip palate and selected medical staff (n = 24) of the two hospitals were carried out. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Over the 6 year period, 25,985 mothers delivered live babies in Kisoro Hospital (n = 13,199) and St. Francis Hospital, Mutolere (n = 12,786) with 20 babies having oro-facial clefts. The overall period prevalence of the clefts was 0.77/1,000 live births. Sixty percent (n = 12) of children had combined cleft lip and palate and the same proportion had clefts on the left side of the face. More boys were affected than girls: 13 versus 7. About 45% of mothers were hurt on realizing that they had delivered a child with an oro-facial cleft. Forty percent of mothers indicated that a child with oro-facial cleft was regarded as an outcast. About 91.7% (n = 22) of the medical staff reported that these children were not accepted in their communities. Surgical intervention and psychosocial support were the management modalities advocated for by most respondents. CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATIONS: The period prevalence of combined cleft lip and palate in two hospitals in Kisoro District was comparable to some findings elsewhere. Cleft lip and cleft palate are a medical and psychosocial problem in Kisoro District that calls for sensitization and counseling of the families and communities of the affected children.

The epidemiologic Data concerned the Parturients, the annual frequency of congenital abnormalities. Distribution of the congenital abnormalities according to the organs, overall mortality and lethality of congenital abnormalities were evaluated. RESULTS: Over 10 years, 1.632 newborns with 1.725 congenital anomalies were recorded. Frequency was 172.5 congenital anomalies per annum. Parturients were less than 35 years in 33% of cases, multigravida in 20%, multiparous in 18% and had a low socio economic status in 96% of cases.

A cross-sectional survey of emergency and essential surgical care capacity among hospitals with high trauma burden in a Central African country,"Kouo-Ngamby, M.; Dissak-Delon, F. N.; Feldhaus, I.; Juillard, C.; Stevens, K. A.; Ekeke-Monono, M.","BACKGROUND: As the overwhelming surgical burden of injury and disease steadily increases, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries, adequate surgical and trauma care systems are essential. Yet, little is known about the emergency and essential surgical care (EESC) capacity of facilities in many African countries. The objective of this study was to assess the EESC capacity in different types of hospitals across Cameroon. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used the WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess EESC, investigating four key areas: infrastructure, human resources, interventions, and equipment and supplies. Twelve hospitals were surveyed between August and September 2009. Facilities were conveniently sampled based on proximity to road traffic and sociodemographic composition of population served in four regions of Cameroon. To complete the survey, investigators interviewed heads of facilities, medical advisors, and nursing officers and consulted hospital records and statistics at each facility. RESULTS: Seven district hospitals, two regional hospitals, two general hospitals, and one missionary hospital completed the survey. Infrastructure for EESC was generally inadequate with the largest gaps in availability of oxygen concentrator supply, an on-site blood bank, and pain relief management guidelines. Human resources were scarce with a combined total of six qualified surgeons, seven qualified obstetrician/gynecologists, and no anesthesiologists at district, regional, and missionary hospitals. Of 35 surgical interventions, 16 were provided by all hospitals. District hospitals reported referring patients for 22 interventions. Only nine of the 67 pieces of equipment were available at all hospitals for all patients all of the time.

The data were analyzed specifically to identify baseline needs for pediatric surgery. Nine hospitals were assessed, and all had a functioning laboratory to test blood and urine and were capable of undertaking resuscitation, suturing, wound débridement, incision and drainage of an abscess, appendectomy, and male circumcision. However, in only 67 % could a pediatric hernia repair be performed, and in none were more complex procedures such as cleft lip and clubfoot repairs performed. Fewer than 50 % of facilities had sufficient gloves, nasogastric tubes, intravenous cannulas, syringes, needles, sutures, urinary catheters, infusion sets, anesthesia machines, or compressed oxygen. Using the standard PIPES tool, we found severe deficiencies in the pediatric surgical capacity at government hospitals in Sierra Leone. However, a pediatric-specific tool is required to understand more accurately the pediatric surgical situation.",2012,,World journal of surgery,36,11,2554-2558,,,21167,#4744,Kushner 2012,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-12 00:45:20)(Select): surgical capacity. table outlining the percentage of selected Sierra Leone government hospitals that had performed procedures at least once (info on burns, contracture release, CL/CP, club foot); ",Barriers to Care
"Surgical Needs of Internally Displaced Persons in Kerenik, West Darfur, Sudan","Kuwayama, D. P.; Chu, K. M.; Hartman, Z.; Idris, B.; Wolfgang, C.; Frist, H. W. H.","BACKGROUND: The burden of surgical disease in refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) populations has not been well defined. Populations fleeing conflict are mobile, limiting the effectiveness of traditional sampling methods. We employed novel sampling and survey techniques to conduct a population-based surgical needs assessment amongst IDPs in Kerenik, West Darfur, Sudan, over 4 weeks in 2008. METHODS: Satellite imagery was used to identify man-made structures. Ground teams were guided by GPS to randomly selected households. A newly created surgical needs survey was administered by surgeons to household members. One randomly selected individual answered demographic and medical history questions pertaining to themselves and first-degree blood relatives. All household members were offered a physical examination looking for surgical disease. FINDINGS: There were 780 study participants; 82% were IDPs. A history since displacement of surgical and potentially surgical conditions was reported in 38% of respondents and by 73% of respondents in first-degree blood relatives. Surgical histories included trauma (gunshots, stabbings, assaults) (5% respondents; 27% relatives), burns (6% respondents; 14% relatives), and obstetrical problems (5% female respondents; 11% relatives). 1485 individuals agreed to physical examinations. Untreated surgical and potentially surgical disease was identified in 25% of participants. INTERPRETATION: We identified and characterized a high burden of surgical and potentially surgical disease in an IDP population in West Darfur. Our study is unique in its direct assessment of a traumatized, mobile, vulnerable population. Health officials and agencies charged with the care of IDP and refugee populations should be aware of the high prevalence of surgical and potentially surgical conditions in these communities. This study adds to the growing body of evidence that investment in surgical resources may address a significant portion of the overall burden of disease in marginalized populations.",2020,,World J Surg,44,10,3224-3236,32462216,10.1007/s00268-020-05603-1,14574,#4746,Kuwayama 2020,"",Burden; Burns
Prevalence and outcomes of pediatric surgical conditions at Connaught Hospital in Freetown: A retrospective study,"Kwasau, H.; Kamanda, J.; Lebbie, A.; Cotache-Condor, C.; Espinoza, P.; Grimm, A.; Wright, N.; Smith, E.","Background Sub-Saharan Africa experiences a disproportionate amount of pediatric surgical disease, with 80% of children lacking access to timely, affordable, and safe surgical care. This study aims to characterize the burden of disease and outcomes of pediatric surgical conditions at Connaught Hospital, the main pediatric referral hospital in Sierra Leone. Methods This retrospective and hospital-based study included children up to 15 years old who were operated on between 2015 and June 2016 at Connaught Hospital in Freetown, Sierra Leone. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to characterize the distribution of disease and compare all variables against age category and mortality. Findings A total of 215 patients were included in this study of which 72.5% (n=132) were male and 27.5% (n=50) were female. Most of the patients were diagnosed with congenital anomalies (60.9%; n=131). However, infection was the leading diagnosis (60.5%; n=23) among patients aged 5-10 years (n=38). Inguinal hernia was the leading condition (65.0%; n=85) among patients presenting with a congenital anomaly. The condition with the highest mortality was infections (17.0%; n=8), followed by other conditions (9.1%; n=2) and congenital anomalies (3.1%; n=4). Based on the results of this study, over 7000 children with inguinal hernias remain untreated annually in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

Day-care plastic surgery in Nigeria: Coping with limited resources,"Legbo, J. N.; Opara, W. Ek","Background: The main problems facing acute surgical services in most countries are shortages of resources and finance, and long waiting lists. The concept of day-care surgery has been well established since the early nineties. Since then, enthusiasts have also indicated that day-care surgery represents a safe, cost-effective and efficient practice. Methods: A 3-year retrospective analysis of all day-care plastic surgical cases undertaken in the unit from January 2001 to December 2003 at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto. Folders of such patients were obtained from the hospital's medical records department. The information obtained was analyzed for demographic data, surgical problems, type of anaesthesia and postoperative complications. Results: A total of 148 procedures were carried out in 137 patients. This represented 37.2% of all procedures done and 36.5% of all patients treated within the same period in the unit. The ages ranged between 2 weeks and 58 years (mean = 23.1 years). There were 66 males and 71 females, giving a male: female ratio of 1:1.1. The most frequently performed procedure was lipomectomy (11.7%), followed by biopsy of skin tumours (10.9%), incision of tongue tie (10.2%), excision of breast lump (9.5%), reconstruction of facial structures (8.8%), ganglionectomy (8.0%) and others. The anaesthesia, used was loco-regional with lignocaine in 92(67.2%) patients, intravenous ketamine in 41(29.9%) patients and inhalation anaesthetics in the remaining 4 (2.9%). postoperative complications were observed in 13 (9.5%) patients, the commonest of which was wound infection (8.0%), followed by bleeding (5.1%), pain (5.1%) and haematoma (2.9%). Readmission rate was 3.6%, mainly due to bleeding and delayed recovery from anaesthesia. Neither significant wound disruption nor mortality was recorded. Conclusions: Good preoperative patient selection and preparation are essential prerequisites for day-care plastic surgery especially in resource-limited environments like ours.

Necrotizing fasciitis: A comparative analysis of 56 cases,"Legbo, J. N.; Shehu, B. B.","Background: The term necrotizing fasciitis (NF) is now used in a generic sense to include all diffuse necrotizing soft-tissue infections except gas gangrene. It is a synergistic, polymicrobial soft-tissue infection associated with rapid progression, extensive necrosis, profound systemic toxemia, considerable morbidity and a high mortality rate. Although the disease is no respecter of age and affects a wide age group, adults are known to be more commonly affected than children. Aims: To highlight the differences and similarities in the modes of presentation and results of intervention of NF in children and adults. Patients and Methods: A four-year prospective descriptive analysis of all consecutive patients with NF (excluding cancrum oris and Fournier's gangrene) treated at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, Nigeria, from January 2001 to December 2004. Results: A total of 56 patients were treated of which 32 (57.1%) were children ≤ 15 years, while the remaining 24 (42.9%) were adults aged > 15 years. There were 31 males and 25 females, giving the male-to-female ratio of 1.2:1; the corresponding ratios for children and adults were 1.7:1 and 1.1:2, respectively. The age ranged from six days to 70 years (mean 19.9 years). Trauma and minor skin infections were the main precipitating factors. The total body surface area (BSA) involved ranged from 1-16% (children 2-16%, adults 1-7%) with a mean of 4.3% (children 5.9%, adults 2.7%). The trunk was the most commonly involved anatomical region of the body (50.0%) in children, while in adults it was the lower limb (54.2%). In both children and adults, infection was mainly polymicrobial. The most common mode of wound resurfacing was by second intention in children (46.9%) and split-thickness skin grafting (STSG) in adults (37.5%). Septicemia was a common complication in both age groups. Mortality was 9.4% and 16.7% among children and adults, respectively. Conclusion: NF is more common in children than adults in northwestern Nigeria.

Necrotising fasciitis: Experience with 32 children,"Legbo, J. N.; Shehu, B. B.","Background: Necrotising fasciitis (NF) in children is rare, rapidly progressive and potentially fatal. A satisfactory outcome depends on early diagnosis and aggressive surgical debridement, along with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Aim: The aim was to describe the various presentations of NF and evaluate outcome of treatment. Patients and Methods: This was a 4-year prospective, descriptive study of all consecutive cases of NF aged 15 years and under treated at Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto, Nigeria from January 2001 to December 2004. Results: Thirty-two children were treated during the study period. The male:female ratio was 1.7:1. Ages ranged from 6 days to 12 years (mean 2 yrs). The commonest predisposing factors were malnutrition (40.6%), boils (37.5%) and intravenous canulation (9.4%). Duration of symptoms ranged from 3 to 19 days (mean 6.4) and the total body surface areas involved ranged from 2% to 16% (mean 5.9%). Half of the patients presented with involvement of the trunk, followed by head/neck (28.1%), upper limbs (21.9%), lower limbs (6.3%) and perineum (6.3%). Most patients had polymicrobial infection, but the organism most commonly isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (71.9%). All patients were resuscitated and had surgical wound debridement, antibiotics and wound care. Final wound resurfacing was by secondary intention (46.9%), direct suturing (6.3%), split thickness skin grafting (21.9%) and local flap reconstruction (12.5%). Septicaemia was the commonest complication (71.9%). The mortality rate was 9.4%. Duration of hospital stay ranged from 14 to 96 days (mean 27.6). Follow-up ranged from 3 weeks to 6 months (mean 52.4 days). Conclusion: NF in children is not uncommon in Nigeria.

W.; Elrod, J.","Introduction: Understand the availability of human resources, infrastructure and medical equipment and perceived improvement helps to address interventions to improve burn care. Methods: Online survey covering human resources, infrastructure, and medical equipment of burn centers as well as perceived challenges and points for improvement. The survey was distributed in English and French via snowball method. Descriptive statistics and AI-based technique random forest analysis was applied to identify determinants for a reduction of the reported mortality rate. Results: 271 questionnaires from 237 cities in 40 African countries were analyzed. 222 (81.9 %) from countries with a very low Human Development Index (HDI) (4th quartile). The majority (154, 56.8 %) of all responses were from tertiary health care facilities. In only 18.8 % (n = 51) therapy was free of charge for the patients. The majority (n = 131, 48.3 %) had between 1 and 3 specialist doctors (n = 131, 48.3 %), 1 to 3 general doctors (n = 138, 50.9 %) and more than 4 nurses (n = 175, 64.6 %). A separate burn ward was available in 94 (34.7 %) centers. Regular skin grafting was performed in 165 (39.1 %) centers. Random forest-based analysis revealed a significant association between HDI (feature importance: 0.38) and mortality. The most important reason for poor outcome was perceived late presentation (212 institutions, 78.2 %). The greatest perceived potential for improvement was introduction of intensive care units (229 institutions, 84.5 %), and prevention or education (227 institutions, 83.7 %). Interpretation: A variety of factors, including a low HDI, delayed hospital presentation e.g. due to prior care by non-physicians and lack of equipment seem to worsen the outcome.

Perspectives on the state of cleft lip and cleft palate patient care in Africa,"Liu, R. H.; Manana, W.; Tollefson, T. T.; Ntirenganya, F.; Shaye, D. A.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with cleft lip -palate (CLP) experience morbidity and social stigma, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as those of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Delays in treatment secondary either to lack of awareness, skills, equipment and consumables; poor health infrastructure, limited resources or a combination of them, has led to SSA having the highest rates of death and second highest rates of disability-adjusted life years in patients with CLP globally. Here we review current perspectives on the state of comprehensive cleft lip and palate repair in Africa. RECENT FINDINGS: To bridge gaps in government health services, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have emerged to provide care through short-term surgical interventions (STSIs). These groups can effect change through direct provision of care, whereas others strengthen internal system. However, sustainability is lacking as there continue to be barriers to achieving comprehensive and longitudinal cleft care in SSA, including a lack of awareness of CLP as a treatable condition, prohibitive costs, poor follow-up, and insufficient surgical infrastructure. With dedicated local champions, a comprehensive approach, and reliable partners, establishing sustainable CLP services is possible in countries with limited resources.

"District-level surgery in Uganda: Indications, interventions and perioperative mortality","Löfgren, J.; Kadobera, D.; Forsberg, B. C.; Mulowooza, J.; Wladis, A.; Nordin, P.","Background. The world's poorest 2 billion people, benefit from no more than about 3.5% of the world's operative procedures. The burden of surgical disease is greatest in Africa, where operations could save many lives. Previous facility-based studies have described operative procedure caseloads, but prospective studies investigating interventions, indications and perioperative mortality rates (POMR), are rare. Methods. A prospective, questionnaire-based collection of data on all major and minor operative procedures was undertaken at 2 hospitals in rural Uganda covering 4 and 3 months in 2011, respectively. Data included patient characteristics, indications for the interventions performed, and outcome after surgery. Results. We recorded 2,790 operative procedures on 2,701 patients. The rate of major operative procedures per 100,000 population per year was 225. Patients undergoing major operative procedures (n = 1,051) were mostly women (n = 923; 88%) because most interventions were performed owing to pregnancy-related complications (n = 747; 67%) or gynecologic conditions (n = 114; 10%). General operative interventions registered included herniorrhaphy (n = 103; 9%), exploratory laparotomy (n = 60; 5%), and appendectomy (n = 31; 3%). The POMR for major operative procedures was 1 % (n = 14) and was greatest after exploratory laparotomy (13%; n = 8) and caesarean delivery (1%; n = 4). Most deaths = 16) were a result of sepsis (n = 10-11) or hemorrhage (n = 3-5). Conclusion. The volume of surgery was low relative to the size of the catchment population. The POMR was high. Exploratory laparotomy and caesarean section were identified as high-risk procedures. Increased availability of blood, improved pen operative monitoring, and early intervention could be part of a solution to reduce the POMR",2015,,Surgery,158,1,7-16,WOS:000356320400003,10.1016/j.surg.2015.03.022,23431,#5061,Löfgren 2015,Rachel Wangi (2025-01-23 01:12:30)(Select): surgeries conducted included Repair of cleft lip or palate; ,Burden; QALYs

L.","IMPORTANCE: In low- and middle-income countries, community-level surgical epidemiology is largely undefined. Accurate community-level surgical epidemiology is necessary for surgical health systems planning. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of surgical conditions in Burera District, Northern Province, Rwanda. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study with a 2-stage cluster sample design (at village and household level) was carried out in Burera District in March and May 2012. A team of surgeons randomly sampled 30 villages with probability proportionate to village population size, then sampled 23 households within each village. All available household members were examined. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The presence of 10 index surgical conditions (injuries/wounds, hernias/hydroceles, breast masses, neck masses, obstetric fistulas, undescended testes, hypospadias, hydrocephalus, cleft lip/palate, and clubfoot) was determined by physical examination. Prevalence was estimated overall and for each condition. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with surgical conditions, accounting for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Of the 2165 examined individuals, 1215 (56.2%) were female. The prevalence of any surgical condition among all examined individuals was 12% (95% CI, 9.2-14.9%). Half of conditions were hernias/hydroceles (49.6%), and 44% were injuries/wounds. In multivariable analysis, children 5 years or younger had twice the odds of having a surgical condition compared with married individuals 21 to 35 years of age (reference group) (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.26-4.04; P = .01). The oldest group, people older than 50 years, also had twice the odds of having a surgical condition compared with the reference group (married, aged >50 years: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.28-4.23; P = .01; unmarried, aged >50 years: OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.02-5.52; P = .06). Unmarried individuals 21 to 35 years of age and unmarried individuals aged 36 to 50 years had higher odds of a surgical condition compared with the reference group (aged 21-35 years: OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.74-3.82; P = .22; aged 36-50 years: OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.29-9.11; P = .02). There was no statistical difference in odds by sex, wealth, education, or travel time to the nearest hospital.

An assessment of orofacial clefts in Tanzania,"Manyama, M.; Rolian, C.; Gilyoma, J.; Magori, C. C.; Mjema, K.; Mazyala, E.; Kimwaga, E.; Hallgrimsson, B.","BACKGROUND: Clefts of the lip (CL), the palate (CP), or both (CLP) are the most common orofacial congenital malformations found among live births, accounting for 65% of all head and neck anomalies. The frequency and pattern of orofacial clefts in different parts of the world and among different human groups varies widely. Generally, populations of Asian or Native American origin have the highest prevalence, while Caucasian populations show intermediate prevalence and African populations the lowest. To date, little is known regarding the epidemiology and pattern of orofacial clefts in Tanzania. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre to identify all children with orofacial clefts that attended or were treated during a period of five years. Cleft lip and/or palate records were obtained from patient files in the Hospital's Departments of Surgery, Paediatrics and medical records. Age at presentation, sex, region of origin, type and laterality of the cleft were recorded. In addition, presence of associated congenital anomalies or syndromes was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 240 orofacial cleft cases were seen during this period. Isolated cleft lip was the most common cleft type followed closely by cleft lip and palate (CLP). This is a departure from the pattern of clefting reported for Caucasian and Asian populations, where CLP or isolated cleft palate is the most common type. The distribution of clefts by side showed a statistically significant preponderance of the left side (43.7%) (χ2 = 92.4, p < 0.001), followed by the right (28.8%) and bilateral sides (18.3%). Patients with isolated cleft palate presented at very early age (mean age 1.00 years, SE 0.56). Associated congenital anomalies were observed in 2.8% of all patients with orofacial clefts, and included neural tube defects, Talipes and persistent ductus arteriosus. CONCLUSIONS: Unilateral orofacial clefts were significantly more common than bilateral clefts; with the left side being the most common affected side. Most of the other findings did not show marked differences with orofacial cleft distributions in other African populations.",2011,,BMC Oral Health,11,,5,21288337,10.1186/1472-6831-11-5,13943,#5318,Manyama 2011,"",Burden; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations
"Surgical admissions to the Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital, Kenya","Masiira-Mukasa, N.; Ombito, B. R.","OBJECTIVE: To describe the pattern of surgical admissions to the Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital and in particular the epidemiologic characteristics of trauma admissions. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Rift Valley Provincial General Hospital, Nakuru from (1st January 1998 - 31st December 1999). SUBJECTS: All patients admitted to the various surgical wards (excluding eye-patients) during the stated period and whose medical records were available and complete. METHODS: Medical records of all surgical patients admitted during the period of study were retrieved using admission data from casualty, surgical out-patient and Annex Hospital registers. Further medical data were obtained from wards admission registers, nurses report books and records from theatre and radiology books. A special data-form was used to collect the required information. The data was subjected to simple statistical analysis. RESULTS: There were 5,907 surgical admissions of whom 3,411 cases seventy three point five percent were trauma admissions, 1,499 cases (25.4%) were non-traumatic emergency surgical admissions and 997 cases (16.8%) were elective surgical admissions. 73.5% of all trauma admissions were males and 57.6% were in the 21-60 year age-group. The most common injuries were soft-tissue injuries, fractures, burn injuries and head injuries, while the leading causes of trauma were road traffic accidents (32.7%), assaults (23.8%), falls (15.5%) and burns (13%). Fifty one point seven percent of all performed surgical operations were trauma-related. The mean length of hospital stay for trauma patients was 10.4 days. Trauma was the leading cause of death (6.6%) among all surgical admissions.

Barriers to Cleft Lip and Palate Repair Around the World,"Massenburg, B. B.; Jenny, H. E.; Saluja, S.; Meara, J. G.; Shrime, M. G.; Alonso, N.","BACKGROUND: Cleft lip and/or palate (CLP) is estimated to occur in 1 out of every 700 births, but for many people residing in low- and middle-income countries this deformity may be repaired late in life or not at all. This study aims to analyze worldwide provider-perceived barriers to the surgical repair of CLP in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: From 2011 to 2014, Smile Train distributed a multiple-choice, voluntary survey to healthcare providers to identify areas of need in CLP care worldwide. Data on provider-reported barriers to care were aggregated by year, country, and larger world regions. RESULTS: A total of 1997 surveys were completed by surgeons and healthcare providers (60.7% response rate). The most commonly reported barriers were ""patient travel costs"" (60.7%), ""lack of patient awareness"" (54.1%), and ""lack of financial support"" (52.8%). ""Patient travel costs"" was the most commonly reported barrier in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. ""Lack of financial support"" was the most commonly reported barrier in the Americas, Eastern Europe, and East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest intercontinental study on healthcare provider-identified barriers to care, representing the limitations experienced by healthcare professionals in providing corrective surgery for CLP around the world. Financial risk protection from hidden costs, such as patient travel costs, is essential. Community health workers and nurses are critical for communication and linking CLP care to the rest of the community.

C.","INTRODUCTION: Injury accounts for 9.6% of the global mortality burden, disproportionately affecting those living in low- and middle-income countries. In an effort to improve trauma care in Rwanda, the Ministry of Health developed a prehospital service, Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente (SAMU), and established an emergency medicine training program. However, little is known about patients receiving prehospital and emergency trauma care or their outcomes. The objective was to develop a linked prehospital-hospital database to evaluate patient characteristics, mechanisms of injury, prehospital and hospital resource use, and outcomes among injured patients receiving acute care in Kigali, Rwanda. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at University Teaching Hospital - Kigali, the primary trauma centre in Rwanda. Data was included on all injured patients transported by SAMU from December 2012 to February 2015. SAMU's prehospital database was linked to hospital records and data were collected using standardised protocols by trained abstractors. Demographic information, injury characteristics, acute care, hospital course and outcomes were included. RESULTS: 1668 patients were transported for traumatic injury during the study period. The majority (77.7%) of patients were male. The median age was 30 years. Motor vehicle collisions accounted for 75.0% of encounters of which 61.4% involved motorcycles. 48.8% of patients sustained injuries in two or more anatomical regions. 40.1% of patients were admitted to the hospital and 78.1% required surgery. The overall mortality rate was 5.5% with nearly half of hospital deaths occurring in the emergency centre. CONCLUSION: A linked prehospital and hospital database provided critical epidemiological information describing trauma patients in a low-resource setting. Blunt trauma from motor vehicle collisions involving young males constituted the majority of traumatic injury. Among this cohort, hospital resource utilisation was high as was mortality. This data can help guide the implementation of interventions to improve trauma care in the Rwandan setting.",2016,,Afr J Emerg Med,6,4,191-197,30456094,10.1016/j.afjem.2016.10.001,15041,#5442,Mbanjumucyo 2016,Rachel Wangi (2025-02-12 00:59:54)(Select): Included some reconstructive surgical conditions; ,Burden; Road Traffic Accidents; Trauma
Experiences with surgical treatment of chronic lower limb ulcers at a tertiary hospital in northwestern Tanzania: a prospective review of 300 cases,"Mbunda, F.; McHembe, M. D.; Chalya, P. L.; Rambau, P.; Mshana, S. E.; Kidenya, B. R.; Gilyoma, J. M.","BACKGROUND: Chronic lower limb ulcers constitute a major public health problem of great important all over the world and contribute significantly to high morbidity and long-term disabilities. There is paucity of information regarding chronic lower limb ulcers in our setting; therefore it was necessary to conduct this study to establish the patterns and outcome of chronic lower limb ulcers and to identify predictors of outcome in our local setting. METHODS: This was a descriptive prospective study of patients with chronic lower limb ulcers conducted at Bugando Medical Centre between November 2010 and April 2012. Ethical approval to conduct the study was sought from relevant authorities. Statistical data analysis was done using SPSS version 17.0 and STATA version 11.0. RESULTS: A total of 300 patients were studied. Their ages ranged from 3 months to 85 years (median 32 years). The male to female ratio was 2:1. The median duration of illness was 44 days. Traumatic ulcer was the most frequent type of ulcer accounting for 60.3% of patients. The median duration of illness was 44 days. The leg was commonly affected in 33.7% of cases and the right side (48.7%) was frequently involved. Out of 300 patients, 212 (70.7%) had positive aerobic bacterial growth within 48 hours of incubation. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.5%) was the most frequent gram negative bacteria isolated, whereas gram positive bacteria commonly isolated was Staphylococcus aureus (13.7%). Twenty (6.7%) patients were HIV positive with a median CD4+ count of 350 cells/μl. Mycological investigation was not performed. Bony involvement was radiologically reported in 83.0% of cases. Histopathological examination performed in 56 patients revealed malignancy in 20 (35.7%) patients, of which malignant melanoma (45.0%) was the most common histopathological type. The vast majority of patients, 270 (90.0%) were treated surgically, and surgical debridement was the most common surgical procedure performed in 24.1% of cases. Limb amputation rate was 8.7%. Postoperative complication rate was 58.3% of which surgical site infection (77.5%) was the most common post-operative complications. The median length of hospital stay was 23 days. Mortality rate was 4.3%. Out of the two hundred and eighty-seven (95.7%) survivors, 253 (91.6%) were treated successfully and discharged well (healed). After discharge, only 35.5% of cases were available for follow up at the end of study period. CONCLUSION: Chronic lower limb ulcers remain a major public health problem in this part of Tanzania.

Factors Contributing to and Reducing Delays in the Provision of Adequate Care in Ghana: A Qualitative Study of Trauma Care Providers,"Mesic, A.; Gyedu, A.; Mehta, K.; Goodman, S. K.; Mock, C.; Quansah, R.; Donkor, P.; Stewart, B.","BACKGROUND: Ghana has a large and growing burden of injury morbidity and mortality. There is a substantial unmet need for trauma surgery, highlighting a need to understand gaps in care. METHODS: We conducted 8 in-depth interviews with trauma care providers (surgeons, nurses, and specialists) at a large teaching hospital to understand factors that contribute to and reduce delays in the provision of adequate trauma care for severely injured patients. The study aimed to understand whether providers thought factors differed between patients that were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and those that were not. Findings were presented for the third delay (provision of appropriate care) in the Three Delays Framework. RESULTS: Key findings included that most factors contributing delays in the provision of adequate care were related to the costs of care, including for diagnostics, medications, and treatment for patients with and without NHIS subscription. Other notable factors included conflicts between providers, resource constraints, and poor coordination of care at the facility. Factors which reduce delays included advocacy by providers and informal processes for prioritizing critical injuries. CONCLUSION: We recommend facility-level changes including increasing equity in access to trauma and elective surgery through targeted system strengthening efforts (e.g., a scheduled back-up call system for surgeons, anesthetists, other specialists, and nurses; designated operating theatres and staff for emergencies; training of staff), policy changes to simplify the insurance renewal and subscription processes, and future research on the costs and benefits of including diagnostics, medications, and common trauma services into the NHIS benefits package.",2022,,World J Surg,46,11,2607-2615,35994075,10.1007/s00268-022-06686-8,14139,#5587,Mesic 2022,"Sabina Rodriguez (2025-01-30 09:26:24)(Select): Qualitative study on the identified delays by staff of hospital (surgeons, nurses...)

Any intervention such as surgery for a patient with a cleft should improve the quality of life of the patient. Patient reported outcomes drives patient centred care and is one way to determine outcomes which matter most to the patient. This ongoing study sought to determine the quality of life(QOL) of the patient with a cleft lip or palate scheduled for surgery. Methods/Description: This was an analytic cross-sectional study of the quality of life of 34 patients (aged 8-29 years) planned for cleft lip or palate repair that were recruited from six participating tertiary hospitals. Sociodemographic, clinical, and QOL measures were obtained before the scheduled surgery. The Cleft Questionnaire (Cleft Q) was adapted for measurement of the quality of life and the raw scores were Rasch transformed. Data was analysed using Stata version 17.0 (Stata Corp, Texas, USA) statistical software. Derived QOL scores were compared with established normative values. Relationships between independent variables and primary outcome measures were analyzed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and one-way analysis of variance. A P-value < 0.05 was set as statistically significant Results: Thirty-four (females 18, males 16) patients were scheduled for surgery of either cleft lip n=7(20.6%) or cleft palate n=27 (79.4). Patients scheduled for primary surgeries were more than those for secondary surgeries, 23 (68.7%) vs 10 (30.3%). Of the QOL scales, the speech distress score was the least (56.0 ±22.6) and the psychological score highest (73.9±15.8). All QOL mean scores except the psychological score fell below normative Cleft Q scores. The psychological scores in males (80.9 ±16.2) were significantly higher than in females (67.7±12.9, p=0.01).

"Trends of cleft surgeries and predictors of late primary surgery among children with cleft lip and palate at the University College Hospital, Nigeria: A retrospective cohort study","Michael, A. I.; Olorunfemi, G.; Olusanya, A.; Oluwatosin, O.","BACKGROUND: Cleft of the lip and palate is the most common craniofacial birth defect with a worldwide incidence of one in 700 live births. Early surgical repairs are aimed at improving appearance, speech, hearing, psychosocial development and avoiding impediments to social integration. Many interventions including the Smile Train partner model have been introduced to identify and perform prompt surgical procedures for the affected babies. However, little is known about the trends of the incidence and surgical procedures performed at our hospital. Nothing is also known about the relationship between the clinical characteristics of the patients and the timing of primary repairs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the trends in cleft surgeries, patterns of cleft surgeries and identify factors related to late primary repair at the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study and trends analysis of babies managed for cleft lip and palate from January 2007 to January 2019 at the UCH, Ibadan was conducted. The demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the Smile Train enabled cleft database of the hospital. The annual trends in rate of cleft surgeries (number of cleft surgeries per 100,000 live births) was represented graphically. Chi square test, Student's t-test and Mann Whitney U were utilised to assess the association between categorical and continuous variables and delay in cleft surgery (≥12 months for lip repair, ≥18months for palatal repair). Kaplan-Meier graphs with log-rank test was used to examine the association between sociodemographic variables and the outcome (late surgery). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was conducted to obtain the hazard or predictors of delayed cleft lip surgery. Stata version 17 (Statacorp, USA) statistical software was utilised for analysis. RESULTS: There were 314 cleft surgeries performed over the thirteen-year period of study. The male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The mean age of the patients was 58.08 ± 99.65 months. The median age and weight of the patients were 11 (IQR:5-65) months and 8 (IQR: 5.5-16) kg respectively. Over half (n = 184, 58.6%) of the cleft surgeries were for primary repairs of the lip and a third (n = 94, 29.9%) were surgeries for primary repairs of the palate. Millard's rotation advancement flap was the commonest lip repair technique with Fishers repair introduced within two years into the end of the study. Bardachs two flap palatoplasty has replaced Von Langenbeck palatoplasty as the commonest method of palatal repair. The prevalence of late primary cleft lip repair was about a third of the patients having primary cleft lip surgery while the prevalence of late palatal repair was more than two thirds of those who received primary palatoplasty. Compared with children who had bilateral cleft lip, children with unilateral cleft lip had a significantly increased risk of late primary repair (Adj HR: 22.4, 955 CI: 2.59-193.70, P-value = 0.005).

The University Teaching Hospital of Kigali hosts the only dedicated burn unit in Rwanda and has collected data on patients admitted for acute burn care in logbooks since 2005. This study aimed to assess the data registered between January 2005 and December 2019, to evaluate the extent of missing data, and to identify possible factors associated with ""missingness."" All data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Fisher's exact test, and Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. In this study, 1093 acute burn patients were included and 64.2% of them had incomplete data. Data completeness improved significantly over time. The most commonly missing variables were whether the patient was referred from another facility and information regarding whether any surgical intervention was performed. Missing data on burn mechanism, burn degree, and surgical treatment were associated with in-hospital mortality. In conclusion, missing data is frequent for acute burn patients in Rwanda, although improvements have been seen over time. As Rwanda and other low- and middle-income countries strive to improve burn care, ensuring data completeness will be essential for the ability to accurately assess the quality of care, and hence improve it.",2021,,J Burn Care Res,42,3,526-532,33128370,10.1093/jbcr/iraa198,13348,#5669,Miranda 2021,Lionel Bernard Dumont (2025-03-13 02:11:12)(Select): data about pathologies related to PRS; Rachel Wangi (2025-02-26 22:30:16)(Select): no surgeries were conducted but provides some insights about surgical capacity; ,Barriers to Care; Burden; Burns
Survey of care and evaluation of east African burn unit feasibility: An academic burn center exchange,"Mitchell, K. B.; Giiti, G.; Gallagher, J. J.","Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, partnered with Weill Bugando Medical College and Sekou Toure Regional Referral Hospital, in Mwanza, Tanzania, to consider the development of a burn unit there. This institutional partnership provided a unique opportunity to promote sustainable academic exchange and build burn care capacity in the East African region. A Weill Cornell burn surgeon and burn fellow collaborated with the Sekou Toure department of surgery to assess its current burn care capabilities and potential for burn unit development. All aspects of interdisciplinary burn care were reviewed and institutional infrastructure evaluated. Sekou Toure is a 375-bed regional referral center and teaching hospital of Weill Bugando Medical College. In 2010-2011, it admitted 5244 pediatric patients in total; 100 of these patients were burn-injured children (2% of admissions). There was no specific data kept on percentage of body surface burned, degree of burn, length of stay, or complications. No adult, operative, or outpatient burn data were available. There are two operating theaters. Patient's families perform wound care with nursing supervision. Rehabilitation therapists consult as needed. Meals are provided three times daily by a central kitchen. Public health outreach is possible through village-based communication networks. Infrastructure to support the development of a burn care unit exists at Sekou Toure, but needs increased clinical focus, human resource capacity building, and record-keeping to track accurate patient numbers. A multidisciplinary center could improve record-keeping and outcomes, encourage referrals, and facilitate outreach through villages. © 2013 by the American Burn Association.",2013,,Journal of Burn Care and Research,34,1,78-81,,10.1097/BCR.0b013e318269be63,21079,#5682,Mitchell 2013,"",Barriers to Care; Burns; Surgical Capacity
Evaluation of trauma care capabilities in four countries using the WHO-IATSIC <i>Guidelines for Essential Trauma Car</i>e,"Mock, C.; Nguyen, S.; Quansah, R.; Arreola-Risa, C.; Viradia, R.; Joshipura, M.","Background: We sought to identify affordable and sustainable methods to strengthen trauma care capabilities globally, especially in developing countries, using the Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care. These guidelines were created by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Society of Surgery and provide recommendations on elements of trauma care that should be in place at the range of health facilities globally. Methods: The guidelines were used as a basis for needs assessments in 4 countries selected to represent the world's range of geographic and economic conditions: Mexico (middle income; Latin America); Vietnam (low income; east Asia); India (low income; south Asia); and Ghana (low income; Africa). One hundred sites were assessed, including rural clinics (n = 51), small hospitals (n = 34), and large hospitals (n = 15). Site visits utilized direct inspection and interviews with administrative and clinical staff. Results: Resources were partly adequate or adequate at most large hospitals, but there were gaps that could be improved, especially in low-income settings, such as shortages of airway equipment, chest tubes, and trauma-related medications; and prolonged periods where critical equipment (e.g., X-ray, laboratory) were unavailable while awaiting repairs. Rural clinics everywhere had difficulties with basic supplies for resuscitation even though some received significant trauma volumes. In all settings, there was a dearth of administrative functions to assure quality trauma care, including trauma registries, trauma-related quality improvement programs, and regular in-service training. Conclusions: This study identified several low-cost ways in which to strengthen trauma care globally. It also has demonstrated the usefulness of the Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care in providing an internationally applicable, standardized template by which to assess trauma care capabilities.",2006,,World J.Surg.,30,6,946-956,WOS:000238356400005,10.1007/s00268-005-0768-4,24088,#5705,Mock 2006,"",Barriers to Care; Trauma
Utilization of district health services by injured persons in a rural area of Ghana,"Mock, C.; Ofosu, A.; Gish, O.","Introduction: Injury is a significant health problem in many less developed countries. However, strategies for dealing with it have been only minimally addressed. Goals: We ought to assess the pattern of health care utilization by injured persons in rural Ghana. We thus hoped to provide data that would assist in strengthening injury treatment in this setting. Methods: Using household interviews, we surveyed 9442 person. We sought information on any injury during the previous year that resulted in one or more days of disability. Injured persons were interviewed regarding the mechanism of injury, treatment obtained and length of disability. Results: During the previous year, 923 nonfatal injuries were reported. Half the injured per sons (49%) received no formal medical care. When treatment was received, it was primarily delivered by a non-doctor staffed primary health care (PHC) clinic. Such clinics provided treatment for 30% of all injured persons (58% of those receiving formal medical care). Twenty percent of the injured received hospital-based care (39% of those receiving formal medical care). Among those using hospitals, the majority (92%) used district hospitals. Conclusions: In this setting, efforts to improve injury treatment should include district hospitals and PHC clinics. At both there is a need to advance the concept of 'essential' injury treatment services, addressing equipment, supplies and training. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2001,,Int. J.

"Management Outcome and Factors Associated with Pediatric Surgical Patient Admitted to Arbaminch General Hospital, Southern Ethiopia, 2021: Retrospective Cross-Sectional Study","Moga, F.; Assefa, F.; Wondwossen, K.; Berhan, Y.","Background. Pediatric surgical situations are often disregarded around the world, particularly in developing countries. The number of children hospitalized for surgical reasons has climbed dramatically. There is extensive research on the management outcome of pediatric surgical admissions in industrialized countries, but developing countries have paid little attention to it. Furthermore, to the best of the authors' knowledge, there has been no research in the study area on the management outcome of pediatric surgical patient admission. Objective. To assess management outcome and factors associated with pediatric surgical patients admitted to Arbaminch General Hospital, Southern Ethiopia, 2021. Method. An institution-based retrospective cross-sectional study design was employed among 265 children with surgical problems. Data were collected from patients' medical records using pretested data collection checklist. Epi Data 4.2 was used to enter data, and data were exported to SPSS version 25 for analysis. Those variables with P-value ≤0.25 in bivariable analysis were entered into multivariable logistic regression analysis, and statistical significance was declared at P<0.05. Result. A total of 265 surgically admitted children were included in this study. About 26% of study subjects were discharged with unfavorable management outcome. Children admitted due to trauma cause (AOR: 5.753, 95% CI: 2.366-13.987), children with a preexisting medical condition (AOR: 3.240, 95% CI: 1.436-7.310), children with an early complication (AOR: 2.515, 95% CI: 1.130-5.599), presenting to hospital ≥24 hr after the onset (AOR:8.351, 95% CI: 2.089-33.381), hospital stay >7 days (AOR: 10.671, 95% CI: 1.363-83.546), and children treated with surgery (AOR: 2.742, 95% CI: 1.137-6.611) were associated with unfavorable management outcome. Conclusion and recommendations: Twenty-six percent of patients were discharged with unfavorable outcome. Reasons for admission, preexisting medical condition, early complications, duration of hospital presentation, length of hospitalization, and type of management were all linked to the outcome of pediatric surgical admission.

"Clinical profile of pediatric burn patients in burn care unit of halibet hospital in 2018: Asmara, eritrea","Mohammed, M.; Mekonen, Y.; Berhe, H.","Background: Pediatric burn injuries result in severe and long-term complications in the developing world, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Accurate data on burn injuries are either unavailable or incomplete in Eritrea. Objective: The objective of this study was to define the clinical characteristics of pediatric burn injuries in the Burn Care Unit of Halibet hospital in 2018 in Asmara, Eritrea. Methods: The study design was a retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study. The medical records of pediatric patients aged 15 years and below admitted to the Burn Care Unit of Halibet hospital between January 2018 and December 2018 were assessed. Results: In the study period, 524 children with burn injuries were admitted to the Unit. The mean age of the study group was 4.2±3.7 years. Nearly 75% of the patients were in the age group 1–5 years. In 95.3% of the patients, scalds were the most common type of burn with burn injury occurring mostly indoor in 98.1% of cases. The average length of hospital stay was 4.6±8.4 days with a median of 1 day. In 94.8% of the patients, the body surface area involved was 1–10%, and the most body part involved was the extremity in 80.7% of the cases. Patients with body surface involvement >10% and who came from rural areas stayed longer in hospital and those with scald burns have a shorter hospital stay. Patients with body surface area involvement >10% and who came from rural areas also have more complications. Conclusion: The most affected age group were 1–5 years old children with scalds being the most common type of burns with injury occurring mostly indoors in this population.

H.; Aguéhoundé, C.","OBJECTIVES: Treatment of congenital clubfoot improved in occidental country. We have studied the epidemiology, clinical and therapeutic aspects of this malformation in the context of Africa. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Two thousand five hundred and sixty-two patients were hospitalised and operated during 12 years, 362 of them were diagnosed with congenital clubfoot. This represented 14,1% of the surgical diseases, with an incidence of 30,2 cases per year. The male to female ratio was 1,6:1, and ages ranged from 4 months to 38 years old, 59% of which were less than 15 years old. Two hundred and four (56,3%) patients had bilateral disease, 93 (25,7%) had right side disease and 65 (18%) had left sided disease. Considering the classification types we noted in our patient population 82% type III, 5% type II, 3% type I and 10% were undefined. RESULTS: Posteromedial approach describe by Codivilla was used in 45,5% of cases. Codivilla approach associated with lateral access to the foot in 44,4% of cases, with dorsal access in 2,3%.

Economic and Social Costs of Noma: Design and Application of an Estimation Model to Niger and Burkina Faso,"Mpinga, E. K.; Srour, M. L.; Moussa, M. A.; Dupuis, M.; Kagoné, M.; Grema, M. S. M.; Zacharie, N. B.; Baratti-Mayer, D.","BACKGROUND: While noma affects hundreds of thousands of children every year, taking their lives, disfiguring them and leaving them permanently disabled, the economic and social costs of the disease have not been previously estimated. An understanding of the nature and levels of these costs is much needed to formulate and implement strategies for the prevention and control of this disease, or to mitigate its burden. The objectives of our study were to develop a model for estimating the economic and social costs of noma and to provide estimates by applying this model to the specific contexts of two countries in the ""noma belt"", namely Burkina Faso and Niger. METHODS: Three main approaches were used. The estimation of prevalence levels of potential noma cases and of cases that should receive and actually do receive medical care was carried out using a literature review. The documentary approach made it possible to estimate the direct costs of noma by analyzing the database of a non-governmental organization operating in this field and present in both countries. Indirect costs were estimated using the human capital method and the cost component analysis technique. RESULTS: The direct costs of care and management of noma survivors amount to approximately USD 30 million per year in Burkina Faso, compared to approximately USD 31 million in Niger. They mainly include costs for medical treatment, surgery, hospital stays, physiological care, psychological care, social assistance, schooling, vocational training and care abroad. Indirect costs are estimated at around 20 million in lost production costs in Burkina and around 16 million in Niger. Costs related to premature deaths are estimated at more than USD 3.5 billion in Burkina Faso and USD 3 billion in Niger. Finally, the costs to survivors who are unable to marry are around USD 13.4 million in Burkina and around USD 15 million in Niger. Intangible costs were not calculated. CONCLUSIONS: The neglect of noma and inaction in terms of prevention and control of the disease have enormous economic and social costs for households, communities and states. Future studies of this kind are necessary and useful to raise awareness and eradicate this disease, which impacts the health and well-being of children and results in lifelong suffering and severe economic and social costs to survivors and their families.",2022,,Trop Med Infect Dis,7,7,,35878131,10.3390/tropicalmed7070119,15072,#5864,Mpinga 2022,"",Cost; Noma
A plastic and reconstructive surgery landscape assessment of Malawi: a scoping review of Malawian literature,"Msokera, C.; Xepoleas, M.; Collier, Z. J.; Naidu, P.; Magee, W., 3rd","BACKGROUND: Plastic and reconstructive surgery (PRS) remains highly relevant to the unmet need for surgery in Malawi. Better understanding the current PRS landscape and its barriers may help address some of these challenges. This scoping review aimed to describe: (1) the scope and focus of the PRS literature being produced in Malawi and (2) the challenges, deficits, and barriers to providing accessible, high-quality PRS in Malawi. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted on four databases (SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE) from inception through September 1, 2020 following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 3852 articles, of which 31 were included that examined the burden of PRS-related conditions in Malawi. Of these 31 articles, 25 primarily discussed burn-related care. Burns injuries have a high mortality rate; between 27 and 75% in the studies. The literature revealed that there are only two burn units nationally with one PRS specialist in each unit, compounded by a lack of interest in PRS specialization by Malawian medical students. Congenital anomalies were the only other PRS-related condition examined and reported in the literature, accounting for 23% of all pediatric surgeries in tertiary facilities. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to increase the country's capacity to handle burn reconstruction and other PRS-related conditions to reduce overall morbidity and mortality. Additional publicly funded research at the district and community level is warranted to determine the true burden of PRS disease in Malawi to derive health system strengthening and workforce capacity building strategies.",2022,,Eur J Med Res,27,1,119,35820981,10.1186/s40001-022-00714-y,13301,#5873,Msokera 2022,"",Burden
Non-Obstetric Surgical Care at Three Rural District Hospitals in Rwanda: More Human Capacity and Surgical Equipment May Increase Operative Care,"Muhirwa, E.; Habiyakare, C.; Hedt-Gauthier, B. L.; Odhiambo, J.; Maine, R.; Gupta, N.; Toma, G.; Nkurunziza, T.; Mpunga, T.; Mukankusi, J.; Riviello, R.","BACKGROUND: Most mortality attributable to surgical emergencies occurs in low- and middle-income countries. District hospitals, which serve as the first-level surgical facility in rural sub-Saharan Africa, are often challenged with limited surgical capacity. This study describes the presentation, management, and outcomes of non-obstetric surgical patients at district hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: This study included patients seeking non-obstetric surgical care at three district hospitals in rural Rwanda in 2013. Demographics, surgical conditions, patient care, and outcomes are described; operative and non-operative management were stratified by hospitals and differences assessed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Of the 2660 patients who sought surgical care at the three hospitals, most were males (60.7 %). Many (42.6 %) were injured and 34.7 % of injuries were through road traffic crashes. Of presenting patients, 25.3 % had an operation, with patients presenting to Butaro District Hospital significantly more likely to receive surgery (57.0 %, p < 0.001). General practitioners performed nearly all operations at Kirehe and Rwinkwavu District Hospitals (98.0 and 100.0 %, respectively), but surgeons performed 90.6 % of the operations at Butaro District Hospital. For outcomes, 39.5 % of all patients were discharged without an operation, 21.1 % received surgery and were discharged, and 21.1 % were referred to tertiary facilities for surgical care.

"Outcome of burn injury and associated factor among patient visited at Addis Ababa burn, emergency and trauma hospital: a two years hospital-based cross-sectional study","Mulatu, D.; Zewdie, A.; Zemede, B.; Terefe, B.; Liyew, B.","Background: Burn is one of the critical health problems worldwide. Developing countries with sub-Saharan and Asian populations are affected more. Its mortality and non-fatal complications depend on several factors including age, sex, residency, cause, the extent of the burn, and time and level of care given. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of burn injury and its associated factor among patients who visited Addis Ababa burn emergency and trauma hospital. Methods: The institutional-based, retrospective cross-sectional study design was conducted from April 1, 2019, to March 30, 2021. After checking the data for its consistency the data were entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 25. A total of 241 patients who had visited Addis Ababa burn, emergency and trauma Hospitals after sustained burn injury were recruited through convenience sampling method for final analysis. Model goodness-of-fit was checked by Hosmer and Lemeshow test (0.272). After checking multi-collinearity both the bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model was fitted and variables having a p-value less than or equal to 0.05 at 95% CI in the multivariable analysis were considered statistically significant. Result: Adults (age 15 to 60 years) are the most affected groups accounting for 55.2% followed by pediatric age groups (age <15 years) (43.6%) and the elderly (age > 60 years) (1.2%). Scald burn was the major cause accounting for 39 % followed by Flame burn (33.6%), Electrical burn (26.6%), and chemical burn (0.8%). The mean TBSA% was 15.49%, ranging from1% to 64%. Adult males are more affected by electrical burns while adult females and the elderly encounter flame burn. 78.4% of patients were discharged without complications, 14.9% were discharged with complications and 6.6% died. The commonest long-term complication is the amputation of the extremity (19, 7.9%). Age greater than 60 years and TBSA% greater than 30% is a strong predictors of mortality with odds of 2.2 at 95% CI of [1.32, 3.69] and 8.7 at 95% CI of [1.33, 57.32] respectively. Conclusion and recommendation: The mortality rate show decrement from previous studies. Overall scald burn is common in all age groups but electrical burns and flame burns affected more adult and elderly age groups. Extremities were by far, the commonest affected body parts.

Designing a contextually appropriate surgical training program in low-resource settings: the Botswana experience,"Mutabdzic, D.; Bedada, A. G.; Bakanisi, B.; Motsumi, J.; Azzie, G.","BACKGROUND: The global burden of surgical disease and severe shortage of trained surgeons around the world are now widely recognized. The greatest challenge in improving access to surgical care lies in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of surgeons per population is lowest. One part of the solution may be to create programs to train surgeons locally. We present our experience with an approach to designing a contextually appropriate surgical curriculum in Botswana. METHODS: Surgical logbooks from the largest tertiary care center in Botswana, dating from 2004 through 2010, were analyzed to yield total case numbers within clearly defined categories. Case numbers and local surgical opinion were combined to design a contextually relevant curriculum, with the Surgical Council on Resident Education curriculum as a template. RESULTS: Logbook analysis revealed that general surgeons in Botswana manage burns and perform a large number of skin grafts and extremity amputations. However, they perform few colonoscopies and complex laparoscopic procedures. The new curriculum included greater emphasis on surgical subspecialty procedures and surgical management of locally relevant conditions, such as the complications of infectious diseases. Less emphasis was placed on management of uncommon conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease. CONCLUSIONS: There are important differences in the scope of general surgery and the knowledge and skills required by general surgeons in Botswana compared with their North American counterparts.

Referral of Burn Patients in the Absence of Guidelines: A Rwandan Study,"Nezerwa, Y.; Miranda, E.; Velin, L.; Shyaka, I.; Mukagaju, F.; Busomoke, F.; Nsanzimana, J. D.; Mukeshimana, M.; Mushimiyimana, D.; Mukambasabire, B.; Uwimana, L.; Ntirenganya, F.; Furaha, C.; Riviello, R.; Pompermaier, L.","INTRODUCTION: The management of severe burns and pediatric burns requires an organized system of care delivery, which includes referral guidelines. In Rwanda, the burn unit at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK) is the only dedicated burn unit in the country and admits patients of all ages referred from the other provinces. However, since there are no official referral guidelines, it is unknown whether patients with burns are appropriately referred. This study aims to analyze referral patterns among burn patients admitted at the CHUK burn unit and their adherence to the referral criteria listed by the American Burn Association (ABA), comparing patients transferred to the burn unit from facilities within Kigali and those referred from facilities outside Kigali. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with acute burns admitted to the CHUK burn unit with data available on the province of origin from 2005 to 2019. Patients with burns younger than 16 y were defined as pediatric burns, as per the CHUK routines. Characteristics of all burns referred from a facility within Kigali (Pat-K) and facilities outside Kigali (Pat-O) were compared using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. The adherence to ABA referral criteria was assessed for variables with available data, which were total burnt surface area %, burn thickness, cause of burn, and age. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1093 patients, of which 1064 had data regarding if they were referred from other facilities to CHUK. Overall, the median age was 3 y (2-16 y), with Pat-O being older than Pat-K (P < 0.001). Scalds were the dominant cause of injury in both groups; flame was more common among Pat-O than among Pat-K (in 25.5% versus 10.6%, P < 0.01). Burns of larger size and depth were more common among Pat-O, as compared to the Pat-K group [median total burnt surface area % = 19% versus 15.5%, respectively (P < 0.001); presence of full-thickness burns = 55.6% versus 29.7 %, respectively (P < 0.001)]. Hospitalization was longer and in-hospital mortality higher in Pat-O than in Pat-K [LOS = 42 d (interquartile range 11-164) versus 28 d (interquartile range 9-132), P < 0.05; in-hospital mortality = 18.9% versus 10.1%, P < 0.001]. Among Pat-O, 85% had characteristics that mirrored one or more of the analyzed ABA criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no clear guidelines, referral patterns indicate that patients are being appropriately referred for specialized burn care in Rwanda. Compared to patients from Kigali, rural patients had larger and more severe injuries, needed more surgical interventions, and had worse outcomes. Most of referred patients matched criteria listed among international referral guidelines. However, the statement of national referral criteria is essential to improve timely access to adequate care.",2022,,J Surg Res,278,,216-222,35636196,10.1016/j.jss.2022.04.066,13914,#6183,Nezerwa 2022,"",Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care; Burns

The malformations involved the abdomen, gastrointestinal and digestive systems (40.4%), head and neck (19.9%), vertebral column and extremities (28.0%), and urinogenital system (6.2%). The most frequent were anorectal malformations (26.7%), followed by cleft lip and cleft palate (14.3%), spina bifida (13.7%), exomphalos (9.3%), and talipes (7.5%). In all, 143 cases (88.8%) should have been amenable to surgery, but only 86 (53.4%) were operated upon. An overall high mortality (33.5%) was attributed to places of delivery with inadequate medical facilities, delayed referral to more competent health institutions, poor general condition of the patients, associated anomalies, and complications. Postoperative mortality was also high for the same reasons.

Firearm injuries at selected hospitals in Kenya,"Njeru, E. K.; Mutiso, V. M.; Saidi, H.; Mak'Anyengo, K.; Gakuru, J. N.","Background: The burden of injury in low-income countries is greater than in highincome countries, but injury documentation and prevention policies are inadequate. The who, where and how of firearm injuries in Kenya has received little attention. Objective: This study describes the epidemiology of small and light firearm injuries to highlight the problem and stimulate further methodologically and scientifically sound research in the area. Method: This retrospective study involved abstracting socio-demographic data, injury mechanism, intention, resources consumed and outcome information from case notes in the records departments of two major health facilities in Nairobi. Results: Eight hundred and fifty two hospital admissions due to gun-shot injuries were recorded between 1997 - 2002 (average, 142 per year) representing 1.8% of all injury admissions, and 0.2% of total admissions at the two hospitals. There were 10 times more male admissions and 89.9% of those involved were in the 15-44 year age group. Six hundred and twenty nine (85.9%) of the admissions were as a result of intentional injuries (assaults) while 101 (13.8%) were as a result of unintentional injuries. Fourty two (5%) patients died in hospital while 800 (94.5%) were discharged home. The burden on health care facilities included a total of 15,392 ward days for 841 patients whose records were available and a total of 144 ICU days for 19 patients. Seven hundred and eighty four (92.9%) patients underwent some form of surgery, mostly limb surgical toilet with wound excision/debridement. Hospital resources used included 3346 units of intravenous fluids and 518 units of blood. Conclusion: The study recommends that policy makers be sensitized on the magnitude of this problem and more studies on risk factors to be carried out so that the process of testing interventions can begin.",2008,,Annals of African Surgery,3,,3-9,,,22146,#6240,Njeru 2008,"",Trauma
Fournier’s gangrene: a retrospective review of management outcomes and seasonal variations of clinical presentation,"Nnabugwu, I. I.; Onumaegbu, O. O.; Okolie, L. T.","Background: To review retrospectively the outcomes of management of Fournier’s gangrene (FG) and to assess for possible seasonal variations in clinical presentations of FG to a referral hospital in a tropical African country. Methods: The medical records of patients who presented with FG from February 2012 to December 2019 were reviewed. Of interest were age of patient, vital signs at presentation, site of gangrene, duration of hospital admission, and management interventions deployed. Analysis was with SPSS® version 21. Results: Twenty-three of 28 medical records could be analyzed. Median Fournier’s Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) was 5 (IQR:3–10), the median Uludag-FGSI (UFGSI) was 7 (IQR:4–14). In 82.6%, the scrotum was the site of onset; in 8.7%, the lesion had spread beyond the pelvis. Diabetes mellitus (30.4%), HIV infection (13.0%) and nephropathy (17.4%) were identified co-morbidities. There were 2.4 ± 1.0 debridement sessions and 1.5 ± 1.3 transfused units of blood per patient. In 60.9%, the wound edges were undermined and apposed; in 17.4%, split skin grafting or fascio-cutaneous flap cover was deployed. In 17.4%, satisfactory wound closure needed more than 1 theater session. Mean duration of hospital admission was 51.4 ± 19.4 days. No mortality was recorded. Majority (91.2%) presented in hot, dry months of October through March with peak in December. No case presented in the wet months of May through September.

Trauma care and referral patterns in Rwanda: implications for trauma system development,"Ntakiyiruta, G.; Wong, E. G.; Rousseau, M. C.; Ruhungande, L.; Kushner, A. L.; Liberman, A. S.; Khwaja, K.; Dakermandji, M.; Wilson, M.; Razek, T.; Kyamanywa, P.; Deckelbaum, D. L.","Background Trauma remains a leading cause of death worldwide. The development of trauma systems in low-resource settings may be of benefit. The objective of this study was to describe operative procedures performed for trauma at a tertiary care facility in Kigali, Rwanda, and to evaluate geographical variations and referral patterns of trauma care. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all prospectively collected operative cases performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda, the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), between June 1 and Dec. 1, 2011, for injury-related diagnoses. We used the Pearson (2) and Fisher exact tests to compare cases arising from within Kigali to those transferred from other provinces. Geospatial analyses were also performed to further elucidate transfer patterns. Results Over the 6-month study period, 2758 surgical interventions were performed at the CHUK. Of these, 653 (23.7%) were for trauma. Most patients resided outside of Kigali city, with 337 (58.0%) patients transferred from other provinces and 244 (42.0%) from within Kigali. Most trauma procedures were orthopedic (489 [84.2%]), although general surgery procedures represented a higher proportion of trauma surgeries in patients from other provinces than in patients from within Kigali (28 of 337 [8.3%] v. 10 of 244 [4.1%]). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight geographical variations in access to trauma care in a low-income country and the first description of trauma procedures at a referral centre in Rwanda. Future efforts should focus on maturing prehospital and interfacility transport systems, strengthening district hospitals and further supporting referral institutions. Contexte Les traumatismes demeurent l'une des principales causes de deces dans le monde. La mise au point de systemes de traumatologie dans des milieux defavorises pourrait toutefois contribuer a ameliorer la situation. Notre etude avait pour objectif de decrire les interventions chirurgicales pratiquees sur les victimes de traumatismes dans un etablissement de soins tertiaires de Kigali, au Rwanda, et d'evaluer les variations geographiques et les habitudes d'orientation des patients dans le domaine de la traumatologie. Methodes Nous avons evalue retroactivement les donnees recueillies de facon prospective sur l'ensemble des interventions realisees au plus grand centre hospitalier regional du Rwanda, le Centre hospitalier universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), du 1(er) juin au 1(er) decembre 2011 pour les diagnostics lies a des blessures. Nous avons eu recours au test (2) de Pearson et au test exact de Fisher pour comparer les cas issus de la province de Kigali a ceux provenant d'autres provinces.

The tropical diabetic hand syndrome: a surgical perspective,"Nthumba, P.; Cavadas, P. C.; Landin, L.","Tropical diabetic hand syndrome (TDHS) is an aggressive type of hand sepsis that results in significant morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes in the tropics. This study set out to establish a protocol for the holistic management of TDHS to improve digit/hand salvage and function at AIC Kijabe Hospital. This prospective study examined the following demographics of patients presenting to the authors institution between October 2009 and September 2010 with TDHS: their sex, age, comorbidities, length of in-hospital stay, surgical and medical treatment, total cost of treatment, and immediate postdischarge outcomes. A total of 10 patients (3 men and 7 women) were presented with TDHS during the study period. Surgical procedures included a thorough debridement of the hand at initial presentation, followed by procedures aimed at preserving length and hand function, with digit or hand amputation when there was no possibility of salvage. Three hands were salvaged, without the need for an amputation; 2 of these, however, developed severe stiffness with resultant poor function. Fifty percent of the patients developed considerable disability; 3 of these patients had disabilities of the arm, shoulder, and hand, (DASH) scores of >90 at 6 months after treatment. TDHS appears to be more aggressive in some patients than in others; a multidisciplinary approach, with early involvement of the surgical team, and a radical surgical debridement are essential to improved outcomes. Although the goal of medical treatment (ie, glycemic control) is simple and easily achieved, surgical goals (salvage of limb or life, preservation of hand function) are more complex, costly, and difficult to achieve. Educating health care workers, diabetic patients, and their relatives on hand care is an important preventive measure.

"Epidemiology and cost of pediatric injury in Yaoundé, Cameroon: a prospective study","Nwanna-Nzewunwa, O.; Ngamby, M. K.; Cox, J.; Feldhaus, I.; Motwani, G.; Monono, M. E.; Etoundi, G. A.; Dicker, R. A.; Hyder, A. A.; Juillard, C.","PURPOSE: Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children aged 10-19 years and over 95% of injury deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As patterns of injury in the pediatric population may differ from those in adults, risks specific to children in LMICs need to be identified for effective injury prevention and treatment. This study explores patterns of pediatric injury epidemiology and cost in Yaoundé, Cameroon to inform injury prevention and resource allocation. METHODS: Pediatric (age < 20 years) trauma patient data were collected at the emergency department (ED) of Central Hospital of Yaoundé (CHY) from April through October 2009. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were used to explore injury patterns and relationships between variables. Regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of receiving surgical care. RESULTS: Children comprised 19% (544) of trauma cases. About 54% suffered road traffic injuries (RTIs), which mostly affected the limbs and pelvis (37.3%). Half the RTI victims were pedestrians. Transportation to CHY was primarily by taxi or bus (69.4%) and a preponderance (71.1%) of the severely and profoundly injured patients used this method of transport. Major or minor surgical intervention was necessary for 17.9% and 20.8% of patients, respectively. Patients with an estimated injury severity score ≥ 9 (33.2%) were more likely to need surgery (p < 0.01). The median ED cost of pediatric trauma care was USD12.71 [IQR 12.71, 23.30]. CONCLUSIONS: Injury is an important child health problem that requires adequate attention and funding. Policies, surgical capacity building, and health systems strengthening efforts are necessary to address the high burden of pediatric injuries in Cameroon. Pediatric injury prevention efforts in Cameroon should target pedestrian RTIs, falls, and burns and consider school-based interventions.",2020,,Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,46,6,1403-1412,30976820,10.1007/s00068-019-01104-6,13339,#6330,Nwanna-Nzewunwa 2020,Lionel Bernard Dumont (2025-01-14 18:59:47)(Select): Epidemiology of traffic injuries.

Hospitalized for poverty: orthopaedic discharge delays due to financial hardship in a tertiary hospital in Northern Tanzania,"Obayemi, J. E.; Card, E. B.; Shirima, O.; Premkumar, A.; Massawe, H.; Sheth, N. P.","BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal injury contributes significantly to the burden of disease in Tanzania and other LMICs. For hospitals to cope financially with this burden, they often mandate that patients pay their entire hospital bill before leaving the hospital. This creates a phenomenon of patients who remain hospitalized solely due to financial hardship. This study aims to characterize the impact of this policy on patients and hospital systems in resource-limited settings. METHODS: A mixed-methods study using retrospective medical record review and semi-structured interviews was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Moshi, Tanzania. Information regarding patient demographics, injury type, days spent in the ward after medical clearance for discharge, and hospital invoices were collected and analyzed for orthopaedic patients treated from November 2016 to June 2017. RESULTS: 346 of the 867 orthopaedic patients (39.9%) treated during this time period were found to have spent additional days in the hospital due to their inability to pay their hospital bill. Of these patients, 72 patient charts were analyzed. These 72 patients spent an average of 9 additional days in the hospital due to financial hardship (range: 1-64 days; interquartile range: 2-10.5 days). They spent an average of 112,958 Tanzanian Shillings (TSH) to pay for services received following medical clearance for discharge, representing 12.3% of the average total bill (916,840 TSH). 646 hospital bed-days were spent on these 72 patients when they no longer clinically required hospitalization. 7 (9.7%) patients eloped from the hospital without paying and 24 (33.3%) received financial assistance from the hospital's social welfare office. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients do not have the financial capacity to pay hospital fees prior to discharge.

"Clinical patterns and early outcomes of burn injuries in patients admitted at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret, Western Kenya","Odondi, R. N.; Shitsinzi, R.; Emarah, A.","BACKGROUND: Burns are the fourth most common type of trauma worldwide and a major cause of mortality and disability in developing countries. Although burns are common in Kenya, the mortality and morbidity patterns are yet to be well studied and documented comprehensively. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate burn clinical patterns, early outcomes and their associations among patients admitted with burn injuries at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH). METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at MTRH between January 2016 and June 2017. A total of 189 patients admitted to the hospital with burns were recruited into the study. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and chart reviews were used to collect data on sociodemographic variables, burn clinical characteristics and early burn outcomes. Associations between patient characteristics and early burn outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 182 burn patients whose data was analyzed, the median age was 2.4 years (IQR = 5.8) years and 149 (82%) were children below 18 years. Majority (76%) of burns were due to scalds. The commonest burn locations were the trunk and upper limbs (56%). Only 40% of patients received prehospital intervention. The median Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA) was 14.5% and 74% of the patients had 2nd degree burns. The median length of hospital stay was 16 days (IQR = 28) and commonest complication was wound infection. Proportion of deaths due to burns accounted for 9.3% of the patients. A TBSA of 20%-30% (p = 0.01) was associated with presence of burn complications while a TBSA of >10% (p = 0.03) and time from burn to admission (p = 0.03) were associated with the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, death was likely to occur in one in ten patients admitted with burns and TBSA was a predictor of presence of burn complications and length of hospital stay.

Method: A retrospective study of records over 5 years was conducted. The patients’ demographic and burn characteristics, stage of pregnancy, the causes, management, outcome and complications were noted. Results and discussion: Ten mothers were included, with mean age of 30 years (range 17–45 years). The average TBSA was 36.3%, mean gestational age was 18.22 weeks (60% were within the first trimester while 40% were in the third trimester, none was in second trimester). The major cause of burn injuries was flame burns (80%). All dead fetuses were within the first trimester. The most common cause of death of mothers was sepsis. No statistically significant association was found between socio-demographic and burn characteristics and maternal and fetal outcome. The mortality rate of pregnant women is almost three times that of the non pregnant women.

"Vascular injuries: Aetiology, presentation and management outcomes at a tertiary hospital in Lagos, Nigeria","Ogunleye, E. O.; Olusoji, O. O.; Kanu, O. O.","Vascular injuries lead to haemorrhagic shock and distal limb ischaemia, especially with an arterial injury. This life-threatening state mandates urgent evaluation and intervention to save life and limbs. The treatment aims to restore blood flow and replace lost blood within the golden hours, stabilising cardiovascular haemodynamics and averting irreversible ischaemic damage. The aim of this study was to analyse the clinical profile of vascular injuries, management and outcomes in our institution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study covered the period from January 2015 to December 2021. Information of interest were extracted from the medical records of each participant. The results from the data analysis were presented in charts and tables. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients aged 15-78 years (mean 32.30 ± 13.75 years) were included in this study. The male-to-female ratio was 3.6:1. The most common causes were gunshot injury, road traffic accident and iatrogenic injuries. The mean duration from injury to presentation was 9.85 h and mean duration from presentation to restoration of flow was 7.3 h. The most common injured artery was the femoral artery, whereas the most common vein was inferior vena cava. Primary vascular repair was done in majority of the cases.

The Tale of the Unrepaired Cleft-Retrospective Evaluation of Cases Encountered by an Indigenous Mission in a Northern Nigerian Community,"Oketade, I.; Bello, S. A.; Adeoye, J.","OBJECTIVE: This study aims to document the experience of an indigenous surgical mission on the occurrence of unrepaired cleft in 2 visits to Minna, North-Central Nigeria. DESIGN: This retrospective study involved participants with orofacial cleft anomaly at 2 surgical outreaches held in Minna in 2011 and 2017. Baseline data were initially obtained from case files of patients at both programs. Data collected were analyzed employing appropriate statistical tests for continuous and categorical variables. SETTING: Two outreach programs in Minna, North-Central Nigeria by Cleft and Facial Deformity Foundation in 2011 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 117 participants with cleft anomaly were encountered at both surgical outreach programs. The sample prevalence of unrepaired cleft was 61.5% with an overall mean age (standard deviation) of 10 (13.2) years. Most participants presented with unilateral complete cleft lip (70.8%) which was more common on the left side and had no family history of orofacial cleft (54.2%). Information on the surgical program was mostly obtained via friends and relatives in 32.6% and lack of wherewithal to offset the expense of cleft surgery and supportive treatment represented the most common reason for the delay of surgical repair (50%). CONCLUSION: We found a high proportion of patients with unrepaired cleft in our sample which may mirror happenings in other developing world centers. We advocate continued collaborations between indigenous missions and international funding agencies to further encourage continued repair of unrepaired cleft in developing centers.",2021,,Cleft Palate Craniofac J,58,7,888-893,34128403,10.1177/1055665620965437,13940,#6517,Oketade 2021,"",Cleft Palate
Childhood burns in south eastern Nigeria,"Okoro, P. E.; Igwe, P. O.; Ukachukwu, A. K.","BACKGROUND: Burns injuries are recognized as a major health problem worldwide. In children and, particularly, in our environment where poverty, ignorance and disease are still high, they constitute significant morbidity and mortality. Previous studies on this topic in parts of Nigeria either lumped adults and children together or were retrospective. We, therefore, prospectively studied the current trends in burns in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study of burns spanned over a period of 18 months (June 2006-December 2007) at the Paediatric Surgery Units of the Imo State University Teaching Hospital, Orlu, and the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri, Imo State. Data were collected and analysed for age, sex, cause/type of burn, place of burn, presence or absence of adult/s, initial prehospital intervention, interval between injury and presentation, surface area and depth of burn and treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were studied, 31 (58.4%) were male and 22 (41.6%) were female (M:F = 1.4:1). Patients mostly affected were aged 2 years and below. The most common cause of burns was hot water in 31 (58.5%) patients. The vast majority of these injuries happened in a domestic environment (92.5%) and in the presence of competent adult/s (88.7%). Outcome of treatment was good: there were two (3.8%) deaths and 46 (86%) patients had complete recovery. CONCLUSION: Burns is still a major health problem among children in south eastern Nigeria. Fortunately, outcome of appropriate treatment is good. However, we think that poor safety consciousness among parents is a major predisposing factor. Public enlightenment on measures to ensure safe home environment may be necessary to avoid or limit childhood burns.",2009,,Afr J Paediatr Surg,6,1,24-7,19661661,10.4103/0189-6725.48571,13548,#6533,Okoro 2009,Rachel Wangi (2025-03-05 19:43:22)(Select): 7.6% of them required surgery; Rachel Wangi (2025-03-05 19:42:19)(Select): disease burden; ,Burns; Children / Pediatric Population
"Adolescent and adult cleft lip and palate, in Ile-Ife, Nigeria","Oladele, A. O.; Olabanji, J. K.; Awe, O. O.","Introduction: Congenital cleft lip and palate (CLP) defects usually present in childhood, especially in places with available and affordable care. In Nigeria, their incidence is low but late presentation in Adult life have been reported. This article aims at reviewing adolescent and adult CLP patients in our center, with the advent of free and available care, and to document the patterns and management outcomes of these patients as an addition to existing literature on the subject of adult CLP. Materials and Methods: A retrospective review of adolescent and adult CLP patients managed from May 2006 to April 2010. Demographic data as well as clinical information were retrieved from the hospital records and include the type of cleft deformity, surgical intervention prior to presentation, the type of surgery performed and postoperative outcomes. Some pertinent clinical photos were also reviewed. Results: Adolescent and adults constituted 24% of the 137 patients, their age ranged from 13 to 76 years, with a mean, median and modal age of 28, 22 and 20 years respectively. Unilateral cleft of primary palate was commonest with female preponderance. Most never had surgery, others desired revision surgery or secondary procedures. The outcomes were satisfactory in the 37 procedures performed on 33 patients. Conclusion: A relatively high ratio of adolescent and adult clefts is observed. Most of them have never had surgical intervention. Some had failed surgical intervention prior to presentation. Satisfactory outcomes were achieved despite late intervention but failed initial intervention was associated with poorer outcomes.",2012,,Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice,15,4,403-407,,10.4103/1119-3077.104512,21178,#6561,Oladele 2012,Lionel Bernard Dumont (2025-01-14 19:02:46)(Select): Epidemiology of cleft in Nigeria - included; ,Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations
"Management of human bites of the face in Enugu, Nigeria","Olaitan, P. B.; Uduezue, A. O.; Ugwueze, G. C.; Ogbonnaya, I. S.; Achebe, U. J.","Background: Human bites of the face present to the surgeon sometimes with a dilemma as to the method and timing of surgery. Often patients present with soft tissue defects as a result of the injury sustained. Reconstruction therefore becomes absolutely necessary to avoid psychosocial complications. Objectives: The aim of this paper is to review human bites of the face, which presented to the Plastic Surgery Department of the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria over a 10-year period and highlight the epidemiology, presentation, management and its outcome. Methods: A retrospective review of the cases of human bites of the face that presented within a ten year period was carried out. Sources of information were the case notes and operation registers. Information obtained includes age, gender of the patients as well as that of the assailants and the relationship of the assailants to the patients. Sites of the injuries, management and outcome were also obtained. Results: There were 54 patients seen and treated during the period with the age range 16-54years (Mean age, 33.8±2.3). The male to female ratio was 1:1.6. Various surgical procedures including wedge excision and direct closure (for the lip); midline forehead flap cover, composite auricular graft and nasolabial flaps (for the nose) were carried out. Three of the 9 noses bitten were skin grafted and 3 had primary direct closure. Few complications occurred. Conclusion: We conclude that human bites still remain common in our environment. These sometimes need reconstruction due to loss of parts. Minimal debridement with primary closure/reconstruction of human bites of the face; when presented early, gives a good result.",2007,,African Health Sciences,7,1,50-54,,,22304,#6570,Olaitan 2007,"",Maxillo-facial surgery; Trauma
Survey of management of children with cleft lip and palate in teaching and specialist hospitals in Nigeria,"Olasoji, H. O.; Hassan, A.; Adeyemo, W. L.","Objective: A national survey was conducted to obtain an overall view of the current management of children with cleft lip and/or palate in Nigeria. Method: Questionnaires were sent to 44 identified cleft surgeons in all teaching and specialist hospitals in Nigeria. Results: A total of 38 respondents returned completed questionnaires. The findings are as follows: (1) a majority of the surgeons (68.4%) are ""low-volume operators,"" undertaking 10 or fewer new cleft repairs annually; (2) 86.8% of the surgeons repair cleft lip at 3 to 4 months of age, and the most common (71%) unilateral cleft lip repairmethod is the rotation-advancement technique; (3) 50%of the surgeons use straight line repair for bilateral cleft lip; (4) a majority (79%) of the respondents close the soft and hard palates as a single procedure; 47.3% of respondents use the von Langenbeck technique, 21.1% use the double-opposing Z-plasty and 21.1%, the palatal pushback; (5) in the management of protruding premaxilla, 52.6% of the respondents choose adhesive tape; (6) procedures such as alveolar bone grafting, rhinoplasty, and surgical treatment for velopharyngeal incompetence are rarely done as part of cleft management; and (7) the interdisciplinary team approach is practiced by 21% of respondents.

Updates on the epidemiology and pattern of traumatic maxillofacial injuries in a Nigerian University Teaching Hospital: A 12-month prospective cohort in-hospital outcome study,"Olusanya, A. A.; Adeleye, A. O.; Aladelusi, T. O.; Fasola, A. O.","Many studies have been undertaken in Nigeria on maxillofacial trauma. However, only a few have considered both the skeletal and soft tissue injuries (in general) involving all the aspects of the maxillofacial region or considered other etiological sources of trauma apart from road traffic crashes. Fewer still have reviewed the outcome of management of facial injuries in our low-resource environment. This study sets out to examine the recent trends in both the clinical and epidemiological patterns of all facial injuries from all causes seen in a low-resource practice of a developing country. It also assessed the in-hospital treatment outcomes, and the levels of the patients' satisfaction with treatment received in this setting. Over a 12-month period, the clinical records of consecutive patients who were evaluated and treated for maxillofacial injuries in our unit were prospectively acquired, entered into predesigned forms and subsequently analyzed. There were 259 patients (79.5% males) during the study period. The mean age was 32.21(-±-16.588) years. Overall, motor bike crashes, 42.1%, were the commonest source of these traumas; and armed robbery was the commonest form (69.0%) of assault. Mandibular fractures were the commonest maxillofacial fractures (37.8%) whereas head injury had the highest frequency among the associated injuries (71.4%). Closed reduction and immobilization was deployed in 88.0% of those who had treatment and majority was satisfied with the esthetic outcome of the treatment received. Mean length of hospital stay was 12.6 (-±-4.423) days. Maxillofacial trauma poses a significant socioeconomic burden on affected individuals in this study population.

The hand is commonly affected by mycetoma thus compromises its functionality and hinder the patient's daily activities of living. In this communication, we report on 533 patients with hand mycetoma managed over a period of 24 years at the Mycetoma Research Centre, University of Khartoum, Khartoum, Sudan. Eumycetoma was the commonest type of mycetoma (83.3%) encountered. Males were predominately affected (69.2%) with a sex ratio of 2.2:1. The majority of the patients (84%) were young adult below the age of 40 years old at presentation. The generality of patients (86.4%) were from the Sudan mycetoma belt. Children and adolescents (28.1%), farmers (18.2%) and workers (17.4%) were more frequently affected. The majority of patients (67.4%) had disease duration of less than 5 years at presentation. The study, did not document significant history of local trauma, familial tendency, concomitant medical diseases or other predisposing cause for mycetoma in this population. Pain (23.1%) was not a disease feature in this series and 52% of patients had past surgery for mycetoma and recurrence. The right hand was affected most (60.4%), and 64% of them had small lesion at presentation. Conventional x-ray was only helpful in patients with advanced disease and the MRI accurately determined the disease extension.

Cleft Surgery Service at National Orthopaedic Hospital Enugu: impact of free treatment programme,"Onah, II; Ezinwa, C. O.","INTRODUCTION: Previous reports on free surgeries have tended to focus on the numbers of patients treated. Little has been documented on the impact on training hence this report. Such grants should positively impact training, patient outcome and volume of patients. METHODS: A retrospective review of all cleft surgeries carried out two years before and after the commencement of free surgical treatment at the hospital (from November 2004 to October 2008) was undertaken. The demographics were studied for both primary and revisional surgeries. The primary surgeons were noted. Excluded from the study are procedures to remove sutures. Simple arithmetic analysis was used. RESULTS: Seventy-three cleft procedures had been carried out before, while 168 procedures were carried out after October 2006. Eight patients aged over 15 years had lip repairs before while 42 patients over 15 years had lip repair after commencement. Fourteen procedures were carried out by three trainee surgeons before; while 29 procedures were carried out by nine trainees after October 2006. In 2005 an average of four procedures a month were undertaken; this increased by 2008 to eight.

Different protocols of treatment exist. In this paper, we retrospectively review a cohort from two centres, with a discussion on the outcome and its implications. The records of all patients with cleft lip and palate seen in the National Orthopaedic Hospital, Enugu, Nigeria, from January 1993 to December 1999, were sought, and all available case notes reviewed retrospectively. This included new cases seen in the period, and also cases operated during this period. Follow up took place until January 2005, when the data were collated. The records of all such patients seen at Ladoke Akintola University Teaching Hospital Osogbo, Nigeria, from September 2004 to June 2006 were also collated and analysed. During this period, 102 patients were seen (93 at Enugu and nine at Osogbo). Fifteen had isolated cleft palate, 42 had isolated cleft lip and 45 had combined cleft lip and palate. Presentation time ranged from 1 day to 43 years. The palate was not repaired in 20 people after lip repair; two patients with cleft lip and palate completely defaulted; and only one person with isolated cleft palate failed to undergo surgery in this period.

METHODS: A 10-year retrospective study of case files of patients seen with electrical injuries in our centre was carried out from January 1995 to December 2004. Case notes were retrieved and data collated from them were analysed by descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Twenty four (24) case files met the inclusion criteria and were analysed. Electrical burns constituted 2.8% of total burn admissions. Patients' ages ranged from 15 months to 42 years. Male: Female ratio was 4.8:1. Seven (29%) had high voltage injuries, mostly work-related. Sixteen (67%) had low voltage injuries while one (4%) had a lightening injury. Fourteen (58%) presented or were referred more than 24 hours post injury. Fifteen (63%) had a form of surgical treatment with wound debridement (33%) skin grafting (38%) and amputations (29%) being the commonest ones. The mortality was 12.5% with septicaemia as the leading cause of death. CONCLUSION: Late presentation of patients to specialised centres, inadequate management at the primary centres of treatment, poverty and inadequate facilities even at the specialised centres were the main problems encountered.

Skin cancers in albinos in a teaching Hospital in eastern Nigeria - presentation and challenges of care,"Opara, K. O.; Jiburum, B. C.","Background: Albinism is a genetic disorder characterized by lack of skin pigmentation. It has a worldwide distribution but is commoner in areas close to the equator like Nigeria. Skin cancers are a major risk associated with albinism and are thought to be a major cause of death in African albinos. Challenges faced in the care of these patients need to be highlighted in order to develop a holistic management approach with a significant public health impact. The aim of the study was to determine the pattern of skin cancers seen in Albinos, and to highlight problems encountered in their management.Method: Case records of albinos managed in Imo state University teaching Hospital from June 2007 to May 2009 were reviewed. The data obtained was analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results and discussion: In the period under review, albinos accounted for 67% of patients managed for primary skin cancers. There were twenty patients with thirty eight (38) lesions. Sixty one percent of the patients were below 40 years. Average duration of symptoms at presentation was 26 months. The commonest reason for late presentation was the lack of funds. Squamous cell carcinoma was the commonest histologic variant. Most patients were unable to complete treatment due to lack of funds.Conclusion: Albinism appears to be the most important risk factor in the development of skin cancers in our environment.

The intent was to assist in planning strategies for universal access to life-saving and disability-preventing surgical services. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: First-referral health facilities in the United Republic of Tanzania. Participants: 48 health facilities. Measures: The WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was employed to capture a health facility's capacity to perform basic surgical (including obstetrics and trauma) and anaesthesia interventions by investigating four categories of data: infrastructure, human resources, interventions available and equipment. The tool queried the availability of eight types of care providers, 35 surgical interventions and 67 items of equipment. Results: The 48 facilities surveyed served 18.6 million residents (46% of the population). Supplies for basic airway management were inconsistently available. Only 42% had consistent access to oxygen, and only six functioning pulse oximeters were located in all facilities surveyed. 37.5% of facilities reported both consistent running water and electricity. While very basic interventions (suturing, wound debridement, incision and drainage) were provided in nearly all facilities, more advanced life-saving procedures including chest tube thoracostomy (30/48), open fracture management (29/48) and caesarean section delivery (32/48) were not consistently available. Conclusions: Based on the results in this WHO country survey, significant gaps exist in the capacity for emergency and essential surgical services in Tanzania including deficits in human resources, essential equipment and infrastructure.

Estimating pediatric surgical need in developing countries: a household survey in Rwanda,"Petroze, R. T.; Calland, J. F.; Niyonkuru, F.; Groen, R. S.; Kyamanywa, P.; Li, Y.; Guterbock, T. M.; Rodgers, B. M.; Rasmussen, S. K.","PURPOSE: Surgical services for children are often absent in resource-limited settings. Identifying the prevalence of surgical disease at the community level is important for developing evidence-based pediatric surgical services and training. We hypothesize that the untreated surgical conditions in the pediatric population are largely uncharacterized and that such burden is significant and poorly understood. Furthermore, no such data exist at the population level to describe this population. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional cluster-based population survey to estimate the magnitude of surgical disease in Rwanda. Conducted as a verbal questionnaire, questions included representative congenital, acquired, malignant and injury-related conditions. Pediatric responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and univariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1626 households (3175 individuals) were sampled with a 99% response rate; 51.1% of all individuals surveyed were younger than age 18. An estimated 50.5% of the total current surgical need occurs in children. Of all Rwandan children, 6.3% (95% CI 5.4%-7.4%), an estimated 341,164 individuals, were identified to have a potentially treatable surgical condition at the time of the interview.

"Extremity injuries in the Sahelian conflict: lessons learned from a French Forward Surgical Team deployed in Gao, Mali","Pfister, G.; Aries, P.; de Lesquen, H.; Mathieu, L.","PURPOSE: This study aimed to analyse extremity combat-related injuries (CRIs) and non-combat related injuries (NCRIs) treated in the French Forward Surgical Team deployed in Gao, Mali. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using the French surgical database OpEX (French Military Health Service) from January 2013 to August 2022. Patients operated on for an extremity injury less than one month old were included. RESULTS: During this period, 418 patients with a median age of 28 years [range 23-31 years] were included and totalized 525 extremity injuries. Among them, 190 (45.5%) sustained CRIs and 218 (54.5%) sustained NCRIs. Multiple upper extremity injuries and associated injuries were significantly more common in the CRIs group. The majority of NCRIs involved the hand. Debridement was the most common procedure in both groups. External fixation, primary amputation, debridement, delayed primary closure, vascular repair and fasciotomy were significantly predominant in the CRIs group. Internal fracture fixation and reduction under anaesthesia were statistically more frequent in the NCRIs group. The overall number of procedures and the overall number of surgical episodes were significantly higher in the CRIs group. CONCLUSION: CRIs were the most severe injuries and did not involve the upper and lower limbs separately. A sequential management was required with application of damage control orthopaedics followed by several procedures for reconstruction. NCRIs were predominant and mostly involved the hand among the French soldiers. This review supports the fact that any deployed orthopaedic surgeon should be trained in basic hand surgery and preferably have microsurgical skills.

"Cleft deformities in Zimbabwe, Africa: socioeconomic factors, epidemiology, and surgical reconstruction","Pham, A. M.; Tollefson, T. T.","In the African country of Zimbabwe, a variety of socioeconomic factors have contributed to a lack of specialty care and resources for the indigent population. Although cleft lip and palate has a lower incidence in Africa (0.67 per 1000 births) than in Latin America or Asia, access to reconstructive surgery is often difficult to obtain. A surgical team worked with Zimbabweans at the Harare Central Hospital, Harare, to perform cleft surgery for 39 patients. We review the epidemiology of cleft deformities in Africa, our experience with 39 patients with cleft lip and palate, and the techniques used to address 2 patients with midfacial clefts. To our knowledge, this retrospective case review and epidemiologic literature review is the first review of cleft care in Zimbabwe. Poverty in Zimbabwe, caused in part by the highest inflation rate in the world, has contributed to the emigration of a large number of specialists to other countries. In addition, the health care system is overwhelmed by a high prevalence rate of human immunodeficiency virus (25%), leading to a drastically reduced parental life expectancy (mean life expectancy, 36 years). Primary and secondary cleft lip and palate repairs were completed without complications. Children requiring care beyond the scope of this mission were referred to the Republic of South Africa. The cooperation among the Zimbabwean administration, physicians, and nurses was integral to the organization and successful execution of this reconstructive surgical mission. Ultimately, until the socioeconomic conditions improve in Zimbabwe, training and continuing education of local physicians are imperative to advance the care of children with cleft lip and palate.",2007,,Arch Facial Plast Surg,9,6,385-91,17954508,10.1001/archfaci.9.6.qsp70001,13653,#7010,Pham 2007,"",Burden; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations
Getting the job done: analysis of the impact and effectiveness of the SmileTrain program in alleviating the global burden of cleft disease,"Poenaru, D.","BACKGROUND: The study measured the success of SmileTrain, the largest cleft charity globally, in alleviating the global burden of disease (GBD). It was done by estimating averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and delayed averted DALYs because of the global backlog in cleft procedures. METHODS: Anonymized data for all procedures in the SmileTrain global database were analyzed by age, sex, country, region, and surgery type. DALYs averted were calculated using life expectancy tables and established and estimated disability weights. The cost-effectiveness analysis used mean SmileTrain procedural disbursement figures. Sensitivity analysis was performed using various cleft incidence rates, life expectancy tables, and disability weights. RESULTS: During 2003-2010 a total of 536,846 operations were performed on 364,467 patients-86 % in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific region. Procedure numbers increased yearly. Mean age at primary surgery-6.2 years (9.8 years in Africa)-remained fairly constant over time in each region. Globally, 2.1-4.7 million DALYs were averted through the operations at a total estimated cost of US$196 M. Mean DALYs per patient were 3.8-9.0, and mean cost per DALY was $72-$134. Total delayed GBD due to advanced age at surgery was 191,000-457,000 DALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an unparalleled number of surgeries performed and yearly increase by one charity, the unmet and delayed averted cleft GBD remains significant in all regions. Large geographic disparities reflect varied challenges regarding access to surgery. Cleft surgeries are cost-effective interventions to reduce the global burden of disease (GBD).

The burden of waiting: DALYs accrued from delayed access to pediatric surgery in Kenya and Canada,"Poenaru, D.; Pemberton, J.; Cameron, B. H.","BACKGROUND: Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) have become the standard metric for estimating burden of disease (BoD), but have not yet been applied to delayed access to surgical procedures. This study estimates the DALYs accrued from delayed access to surgical care in two pediatric surgical units in Kenya and Canada. METHODS: Records of operations for 13 congenital health states in a Kenyan and a Canadian hospital were prospectively collected for 2012. DALYs caused by delayed presentation were estimated using disability weights and ideal and actual age at surgery. RESULTS: 1208 first-time procedures in general surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and urology were included. Delays were longest in general surgery and longer in Kenya than in Canada in all specialties. The longest delays in Kenya were for orchidopexy (72 months) and anorectoplasty (PSARP) (74 months), and in Canada for orchidopexy (40 months). Corresponding total delayed BoD was highest in general surgery and neurosurgery and higher again in Kenya than in Canada (484 cf. 84 DALYs). CONCLUSIONS: Estimating BoD resulting from delayed surgery is feasible and reflects both late presentation and limited access to care.

The Effect of Surgical Intervention on Pediatric Burn Injury Survival in a Resource-Poor Setting,"Purcell, L. N.; Banda, W.; Williams, B.; Gallaher, J.; Charles, A.","INTRODUCTION: Burns are one of the most common injuries sustained globally. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by burn injury morbidity and mortality; African children have the highest burn mortality globally. In high-income countries, early surgical intervention has shown to improve survival. However, when applied to burn victims in LMICs, improved survival in the early excision cohort (≤5 d) was not seen. Therefore, we aimed to determine the magnitude of the effect of surgical intervention on burn injury survival. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected data, utilizing the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Database from May 2011 to July 2019, was performed. Pediatric patients (≤12 y) were included. Patients were excluded if they underwent surgical intervention for nonacute burn care management. Bivariate analyses stratifying by type of surgical intervention was performed, comparing demographics, burn characteristics, surgical intervention, and patient mortality. Standardized estimates were adjusted using the inverse-probability of treatment weights to account for confounding. Weighted logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the odds of mortality based on if a patient underwent surgical intervention. RESULTS: During the study, 2364 patients were seen at the Kamuzu Central Hospital, 1785 (75.5%) were children ≤12 y who met inclusion criteria. In the overall cohort, 342 (19.2%) underwent operations, including split-thickness skin graft (n = 196, 57.3%), debridement (n = 116, 33.9%), escharotomy (n = 19, 5.6%), and amputation (n = 1, 0.3%). The surgery cohort was older (4.2 ± 3.1 versus 3.1 ± 2.6 y, P < 0.001) with larger percent total body surface area burns (16%, interquartile range: 10-24 versus 13%, interquartile range: 8-20, P < 0.001) than those who did not have surgery. In the propensity score-weighted logistic regression predicting survival, patients undergoing surgery after burn injury had an increased odds of survival (odds ratio: 5.24, 95% confidence interval: 2.40-11.44, P = 0.003) when compared with patients not undergoing surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity-weighted analysis, surgical intervention following burn injury increases the odds of survival by a factor of 5.24 when compared with patients not undergoing surgical intervention.

The effect of burn mechanism on pediatric mortality in Malawi: A propensity weighted analysis,"Purcell, L. N.; Sincavage, J.; Banda, W.; Cairns, B.; Phillips, M. R.; Gallaher, J. R.; Charles, A.","INTRODUCTION: The burden of global trauma disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries, with a high incidence in children. Thermal injury represents one of the most severe forms of trauma and is associated with remarkable morbidity and mortality. The predictors of burn mortality have been well described (age, % total body surface area burn [TBSA], and presence of inhalation injury). However, the contribution of the burn mechanism as a predictor of burn mortality is not well delineated. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, utilizing the Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) Burn Surveillance Registry from May 2011 to August 2019. Pediatric patients (≤12 years) with flame and scald burns were included in the study. Basic demographic variables including sex, age, time to presentation, %TBSA, surgical intervention, burn mechanism, and in-hospital mortality outcome was collected. Bivariate analysis comparing demographic, burn characteristics, surgical intervention, and patient outcomes were performed. Standardized estimates were adjusted using inverse-probability of treatment weights (IPTW) to account for confounding. Following weighting, logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the odds of in-hospital mortality based on burn mechanism. RESULTS: During the study period, 2364 patients presented to KCH for burns and included in the database with 1794 (75.9%) pediatric patients. Of these, 488 (27.6%) and 1280 (72.4%) were injured by flame and scald burns, respectively. Males were 47.2% (n = 230) and 59.2% (n = 755) of the flame and scald burn cohorts, respectively (p < 0.001.) Patients presenting with flame burns compared to scald burns were older (4. 7 ± 3.1 vs. 2.7 ± 2.3 years, p < 0.001) with greater %TBSA burns (17.8 [IQR 10-28] vs 12 [IQR 7-20], p < 0.001). Surgery was performed for 42.2% (n = 206) and 19.9% (n = 140) of the flame and scald burn cohorts, respectively (p < 0.001.) Flame burns had a 2.6x greater odds of in-hospital mortality compared to scald burns (p < 0.001) after controlling for sex, %TBSA, age, time to presentation, and surgical status. CONCLUSION: In this propensity-weighted analysis, we show that burn mechanism, specifically flame burns, resulted in a nearly 3-fold increase in odds of in-hospital mortality compared to scald burns. Our results emphasize flame and scald burns have major differences in the inflammatory response, metabolic profile over time, and outcomes.

This study aimed to assess the relationships between sex, thermal injury, and inpatient mortality in a pediatric burn cohort in a resource-limited setting. METHOD: This is a retrospective analysis of data collected from the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burns Unit, in Lilongwe, Malawi, from May 2011 to December 2019 on all pediatric patients (≤12 years). We performed a bivariate analysis by sex comparing demographics, burn characteristics, surgical intervention, and mortality. Standardized estimates were adjusted using the inverse probability of treatment weights to account for confounding. Following weighting, odds of mortality based on sex were obtained via logistic regression modeling. RESULTS: A total of 1904 children were admitted with a male preponderance (n = 1065, 55.9 %). Overall, the median age was 3 years (IQR1-4). Females had a higher percent total body surface area (%TBSA) burn than males, 15 % vs. 13 % (p = 0.03), respectively. Flame burns were more frequent in females compared to males, 32 % and 23 %, respectively (p < 0.001). There were higher rates of surgical intervention in females than males (20.9 % vs. 16.7 %, p = 0.02). The propensity score weighted logistic regression predicting mortality revealed no difference in the odds of mortality based on sex (OR 1.12, 95 % CI 0.82-1.52, p = 0.5). CONCLUSION: We show males are just as likely to die from burns compared to females with similar injuries in this propensity-matched analysis.

The effects of these demographic changes on the epidemiology of burn risk and thermal injury in Ethiopia are unknown. This gap constitutes a major barrier to the creation of effective burn prevention programs. METHODS: Yekatit 12 Hospital in Addis Ababa is the only burn unit in Ethiopia. In this cross sectional retrospective study, we identified and reviewed all admissions due to burn injury at that facility between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2016. We then compared them to a previously published burn cohort treated at the same facility between 7/1/2001 and 9/31/2002. Chi square was used to compare proportions between the two samples. Continuous covariates are reported as descriptive data due to missing variance data in the 2001-02 publication. RESULTS: There were a total of 121 subjects in the 2001-02 sample and 176 subjects in the 2016 sample.

Management of Human Bites in a Rural Kenyan Setting: A Plastic Surgeon's 8-Year Experience,"Rhodes, I. J.; Mwangi, M. W.; Romeo, D. J.; Rhodes, W. R.; Rohde, C.","INTRODUCTION: The treatment of human bites is a common issue facing healthcare practitioners in the developing countries of Sub-Saharan Africa where it has been noted as a growing public health concern. Generally, the desired outcomes from surgical management are healing, function, and aesthetics. We share our 8-year experience at Kapsowar Hospital in Kenya with the presentation, management, and outcome of human bites. We are uniquely situated to do so given the prevalence of human biting in our community and the full-time presence of a plastic surgeon at our institution. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to present human bite surgical management by a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Surgery working full-time on the African continent. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients who presented to the operating theater at Kapsowar Hospital with a human bite between 2013-2021. After identification of eligible patients, charts were reviewed assessing parameters including age, gender, timing from injury to presentation at hospital, localization of bite, severity of facial wounds using Lackmann's classification, surgical procedure(s), postoperative complications, surgical revisions, antibiotics administered, and circumstance of incident. Data were analyzed using SPSS 29.0.0.0. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were identified. Seventeen (38.6%) were female and 27 (61.4%) were male. Thirty-one patients had facial bites and 13 patients had bites to other parts of the body. Of facial bites, 70.3% resulted in amputation of the affected part while 29.7% were lacerations. Using Lackmann's classification for facial bite severity, IIIA bites (complete avulsion) were most common for both males (9) and females (7). Females comprised 68.4% of total lip bite victims. Bites to the extremity were associated with late presentation and infection. We report a salvage rate of 85.7% for infected digits. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with most other studies on human bites, our patient population presents with a higher rate of avulsive lip injuries, most commonly among women. Our postoperative infection rate is lower than many others reported in the literature.

Associations with Perioperative Mortality Rate at a Major Referral Hospital in Rwanda,"Rickard, J. L.; Ntakiyiruta, G.; Chu, K. M.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about perioperative mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. The perioperative mortality rate (POMR) and associated factors at a major referral hospital in Rwanda were measured. METHODS: The operative activity at University Teaching Hospital of Kigali was evaluated through an operative database. As a part of this larger study, patient characteristics and outcomes were measured to determine areas for improvement in patient care. Data were collected on patient demographics, surgeon, diagnosis, and operation over a 12-month period. The primary outcome was POMR. Secondary outcomes were timing and hospital location of death. RESULTS: The POMR was 6 %. POMR in patients under 5 years of age was 10 %, 3 % in patients 5-14 years and 6 % in patients age >14 years. For emergency and elective operations, POMR was 9 and 2 %, respectively. POMR was associated with emergency status, congenital anomalies, repeat operations, referral outside Kigali, and female gender. Orthopedic procedures and age 5-14 years were associated with decreased odds of mortality. Forty-nine percent of deaths occurred in the post-operative recovery room and 35 % of deaths occurred within the first post-operative day. CONCLUSIONS: The POMR at a large referral hospital in Rwanda is <10 % demonstrating that surgery can save lives even in resource-limited settings. Emergency operations are associated with higher mortality, which could potentially be improved with faster identification and transfer from district hospitals. Nearly half of deaths occurred in the post-operative recovery room.

Facing Africa: Describing Noma in Ethiopia,"Rickart, A. J.; Rodgers, W.; Mizen, K.; Merrick, G.; Wilson, P.; Nishikawa, H.; Dunaway, D. J.","Noma affects the most marginalized communities in the world, beginning as oral ulceration and rapidly progressing to orofacial gangrene. With a mortality rate estimated to be as high as 90% and with very few able to access treatment in its active phase, very little is understood about the disease. This retrospective review of patients treated by Facing Africa for deformity and functional impairment secondary to noma between May 2015 and 2019 highlights some of the difficulties encountered by those afflicted. Eighty new patients with historical noma defects were identified and were seen over the course of nine surgical missions, with notes providing valuable geographical, socioeconomic, and psychosocial information. The mean self-reported age of onset was 5 years and 8 months, with a median time of 18 years from onset to accessing treatment. Before intervention, 65% covered their face in public, 59% reported difficulty eating, 81% were unhappy with their appearance, and 71% experienced bullying.

"Characteristics, prevalence, and outcomes of diabetic foot ulcers in Africa. A systemic review and meta-analysis","Rigato, M.; Pizzol, D.; Tiago, A.; Putoto, G.; Avogaro, A.; Fadini, G. P.","Background: Among non-communicable diseases, diabetes represents a growing public health problem in Africa, where diabetes-related needs remain mostly unmet and the disabling features of foot are worsened by hygienic, cultural, and healthcare issues. We aimed to review clinical characteristics, prevalence, and outcomes of patients with diabetic foot ulcer in Africa. Methods: We searched the literature for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reporting the characteristics of patients with diabetic foot in African countries, with a particular focus on ulcer prevalence, amputation rate, and mortality. Findings: Fifty-five full-text papers and ten abstracts were retrieved, reporting data from 19 African countries on 56,173 diabetic patients. According to the data collected, the overall prevalence of foot ulcers was 13% and increased over time, especially since 2001. Approximately 15% of patients with foot lesions underwent major amputation and 14.2% died during hospitalization. In patients with diabetic ulcers, insulin therapy was uncommon and neuropathy was the most common predisposing factor, but the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease correlated with amputation rates. Amputation and mortality decreased over time, probably as result of the implementation of screening programs in the last ten years. Mortality was directly related to previous amputation. Interpretation: The diabetic foot disease in Africa is a growing problem and is burden by high rate of in-hospital mortality. Educational interventions and screening programs including evaluation of the vascular status may play a crucial role to counter diabetic foot disease in Africa.",2018,,Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice,142,,63-73,,10.1016/j.diabres.2018.05.016,18921,#7378,Rigato 2018,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-17 22:50:13)(Select): Results stratified by country, Burden of diabetic foot ulcer; Sabina Rodriguez (2025-01-17 09:12:53)(Select): Includes South Africa but stratifies results by African Region!; ",Disabling Pathologies; Ulcers
"Burns at KCMC: epidemiology, presentation, management and treatment outcome","Ringo, Y.; Chilonga, K.","BACKGROUND: About 90% of the global burden of burns occurs in the low and middle income countries. In Africa it is estimated that between 17,000 and 30,000 children under five die each year due to burns. In Tanzania there are no specialized burn centers. Burn patients are often managed in the general surgical wards in most hospitals. Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre is one of the four tertiary referral hospitals in Tanzania. RATIONALE: This study aimed to review the epidemiology presentation management and outcome of burn patients in this challenging environment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional prospective study involving 41 patients was undertaken from October 2011 to April 2012. RESULTS: 65.9% were males. The largest age group was below 5 years (36.6%). 19.5% were epileptic. More than half of the burns were due to open flame. 80.5% had second degree burns. 56.1% had a BSA of 15% or less and 56.1% had an APACHE score of 10 or less. It was found that 73.2% of burns occurred at home. The commonest prehospital first aid applied was honey. Only 41.5% arrived in hospital within the first 24h after burn. Among the 14.6% who had skin grafting, none had early excision of burn wound. 53.7% developed wound sepsis while 24.4% developed contractures. The mortality rate was 26.8%.

Prospective evaluation of anaesthesia adverse events occurring during a surgical mission in Madagascar and the relation to postoperative complications,"Robinson, E.; Couch, S.; White, M.","Currently a significant amount of surgical and anaesthesia care in many low and middle income countries is provided by non-governmental organisations (NGO) and visiting teams [1]. These teams typically rely on a team of international surgeons and anaesthetists volunteering for only a few weeks which makes teamwork and communication challenging and may compromise patient safety because surgical complications in these settings are higher than elsewhere [2]. However, the incidence of anaesthesia adverse events on surgical missions is unknown. We report our experience of 851 anaesthetics in Madagascar with the NGO, Mercy Ships. Methods For 6 months (November 2014-May 2015) we collected data prospectively on anaesthetic adverse events and postoperative complications. Complications were defined based on the US Anesthesia Quality Institute data set and divided into intra-operative, postoperative care unit (PACU), ward and surgical complications. Results A total of 851 surgical cases were undertaken by 33 different anaesthetists from 12 different countries. Of these, 247 (29%) surgical cases were children under 14 years. There were a total of 36 anaesthesia or PACU adverse events in 19 patients. Details are shown in Table 1. Surgical case mix was: maxillofacial 38%; plastic/reconstructive 11%; obstetric fistula 10%; paediatric orthopaedic 6% and general 35%. There were 50 postoperative complications (11 return to hospital, 22 return to OR, and 17 surgical site infections [SSI]). Only one was associated with an anaesthesia adverse event. This was an 8 year old boy who experienced a SSI after a neck contracture release where there was a difficult airway and contamination of the neck wound occurred. Discussion The incidence of anaesthesia adverse events was comparable to published data from Western institutions [3]. Maxillofacial surgery is associated with a higher incidence of airway complications due to the 'shared airway' and airway complications are also more frequent in children anaesthetised by non-specialist paediatric anaesthetists. This is reflected in our data: 16/17 airway complications occurred either in children or in head and neck cases or both. The exception was a 55 year old man undergoing hernia repair who was noted to have regurgitation, but no problems postoperatively. In our organisation the presence of one permanent surgeon and anaesthetist; strict orientation and evaluation procedures; and written guidelines including use of the WHO surgical safety checklist are likely contributing factors to the good safety record.

"Prevalence and characteristics of paediatric burns at the National Reconstructive Plastic Surgery and Burns Centre, Korle Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana","Rockson, A. A.; Benjamin-Damons, N.; Pilusa, S. I.","Introduction: Burn injuries among children have emerged as a significant global public health concern, accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Low and Middle-Income Countries bear a significant burden of paediatric burn injuries. In Ghana, limited data exists on the prevalence, characteristics and outcomes of paediatric burns. This study provides vital data on the local burden and epidemiology of paediatric burns at Ghana's main burns treatment center. The findings have significant value in informing prevention strategies, allocating resources, and improving quality of paediatric burn care. Study objective: To establish the prevalence and characteristics of paediatric burns injuries in Ghana's leading burn center. Methodology: A retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 662 adult and paediatric patients who presented with burns from all over Ghana between 2020 and 2022. The study encompassed medical records of paediatric burn cases (aged 0–14 years) admitted to the center from January 2020 to December 2022. A purposive sampling technique was used to select cases based on the inclusion criteria and elimination of cases with 20 % missing data. A total of 335 paediatric records were reviewed. Data analytical methods: Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies, mean, percentages were used to establish period prevalence and demographic characteristics of paediatric burns. Chi-square analysis and univariate logistic regression was utilized to explore associations between categorical variables, and predictors of burn outcome. Results: The period prevalence of paediatric burns was found to be 50.6 %. Paediatric burn cases predominantly affected males (57.6 %). Majority of cases fell within the age range of 1 to 5 years (70.1 %). Hot water emerged as the leading cause (58.4 %), whiles superficial partial thickness burns (51.9 %) was the predominant type of burn. Most cases involved burns affecting less than 20 % Total Body Surface Area (59.0 %). Multi-part body injuries were common (87.2 %), with the lower limb being the most affected (25.36 %). The mortality rate was calculated to be 21.0 %. Higher TBSA was a significant predictor of mortality (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study found a high prevalence of paediatric burns with hot water and foods being the predominant causes. Higher TBSA predicted lower chances of survival. The findings have scientific value in informing prevention strategies, allocating resources, and improving the quality of care.",2024,,Burns Open,8,4,,,10.1016/j.burnso.2024.100358,15423,#7414,Rockson 2024,"",Burden; Burns; Children / Pediatric Population

The mean duration of operation was 442 minutes (range 200 - 720). Six minor wound infections were treated conservatively and did not affect outcome, a return to theatre was required in 4 patients with wound infections and one with a haemorrhage; 2 flaps failed and 2 partially failed, one patient developed an oronasal fistula, and one had an infection at the donor site that required a repeat graft.

Estimated need for surgery worldwide based on prevalence of diseases: a modelling strategy for the WHO Global Health Estimate,"Rose, J.; Weiser, T. G.; Hider, P.; Wilson, L.; Gruen, R. L.; Bickler, S. W.","BACKGROUND: Surgery is a foundational component of health-care systems. However, previous efforts to integrate surgical services into global health initiatives do not reflect the scope of surgical need and many health systems do not provide essential interventions. We estimate the minimum global volume of surgical need to address prevalent diseases in 21 epidemiological regions from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD). METHODS: Prevalence data were obtained from GBD 2010 and organised into 119 disease states according to the WHO's Global Health Estimate (GHE). These data, representing 187 countries, were then apportioned into the 21 GBD epidemiological regions. Using previously defined values for the incident need for surgery for each of the 119 GHE disease states, we calculate minimum global need for surgery based on the prevalence of each condition in each region. FINDINGS: We estimate that at least 321·5 million surgical procedures would be needed to address the burden of disease for a global population of 6·9 billion in 2010. Minimum rates of surgical need vary across regions, ranging from 3383 operations per 100 000 in central Latin America to 6495 operations per 100 000 in western sub-Saharan Africa. Global surgical need also varied across subcategories of disease, ranging from 131 412 procedures for nutritional deficiencies to 45·8 million procedures for unintentional injuries. INTERPRETATION: The estimated need for surgical procedures worldwide is large and addresses a broad spectrum of disease states. Surgical need varies between regions of the world according to disease prevalence and many countries do not meet the basic needs of their populations. These estimates could be useful for policy makers, funders, and ministries of health as they consider how to incorporate surgical capacity into health systems.

Update on the evaluation of a surgical task-sharing program in South Sudan,"Salehi, M.; Zivkovic, I.; Jatana, S.; Joharifard, S.; Joos, É","Background: Globally, Sub-Saharan Africa is the region with the most limited access to surgical care. Growing the surgical workforce is crucial to closing this gap in care accessibility. In 2019, the University of British Columbia collaborated with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to create the Essential Surgical Skills (ESS) program, launched at Aweil State Hospital, South Sudan, in order to increase local surgical capacity. Our objective was to evaluate the progress and surgical competencies of trainees enrolled in the ESS program. Methods: This is a mixed-method prospective cohort study evaluating trainee progress in the ESS program. Quantitative data include pre and post-training outputs (procedure logbooks, morbidity and mortality rates) and surgical proficiency (quizzes, Entrustable Professional Activities [EPAs]). Qualitative data include trainee semistructured interviews. Results: From May 2019 to December 2021, trainees performed 416 procedures. The most common procedures were skin grafting (15.6%), abscess drainage (13.1%) and reduction and splinting (12.3%). A total of 327 EPAs were completed, out of which 254 (77.6%) showed that the trainee could independently perform the procedure. Trainees have demonstrated full competency in the burn management and safe surgery modules. The pass rate for all quizzes was 100%. Surgical mortality rates recorded during the implementation of the ESS program remained unchanged from preimplementation rates (pretraining: 0.6%; during training: 0.1%; p = 0.0541). Surgical morbidity rates demonstrated a decline from 17% preimplementation to 12% postimplementation (p = 0.1767). Semistructured interviews indicated that trainees felt the program was empowering and key to their career development. Conclusion: Our study suggests that providing ESS training to general practitioners in under-resourced settings via a virtual platform is feasible.

C.; Ngoie, L. B.; Metcalfe, A. J.; Lalloo, D. G.; Madan, J. J.; Harrison, W. J.; MacPherson, P.","Background: Injuries are a major cause of disability globally and injury incidence is rapidly increasing, largely due to road traffic injuries in low-income and middle-income countries. Current estimates of the scale and consequences of disability from injury are largely based on modelling studies, with a scarcity of empirical evidence from severe injuries in low-income countries. We aimed to better understand the outcomes for individuals with open tibia fractures in Malawi. Methods: In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, adults (aged ≥18 years) with open tibia fractures were systematically recruited at six hospitals in Malawi (two tertiary hospitals and four district hospitals). Follow-up lasted at least 1 year, during which in-person follow-up reviews were done at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-injury. The primary outcome was function at 1 year post-injury, measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA) score. Secondary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; as determined via the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 3-Levels [EQ-5D-3L] survey) and fracture-related infection at 1 year post-injury. Multilevel regression models investigated associations between SMFA score, EQ-5D-3L, baseline factors, and orthopaedic management. Findings: Between Feb 12, 2021, and March 14, 2022, 287 participants were enrolled (median age 34 years [IQR 25–44]; 84% male). The most common mode of injury was road traffic injuries (194 [68%] of 287). Overall, 268 (93%) participants had debridement; of the 63 participants who were debrided in district hospitals, 47 (75%) had the procedure under local or no anaesthesia. Following substantial declines by 6 weeks after injury, function and quality of life had not recovered by 1 year post-injury for participants with Gustilo grade I–II fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 10·5, 95% highest density interval [HDI]: 9·5–11·6; QALYs: 0·73, 95% HDI: 0·66–0·80) nor Gustilo grade III fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 14·9, 95% HDI: 13·4–16·6; QALYs: 0·67, 95% HDI: 0·59–0·75). For all fracture grades, intramedullary nailing substantially improved function and quality of life at 1 year post-injury. Delayed definitive fixation after 5 days had 5-times greater odds of infection compared with early management within 2 days (adjusted odds ratio: 5·1, 95% CI 1·8–16·1; p=0·02). Interpretation: Adults with open tibia fractures in Malawi have poor function and quality of life in the 1 year following injury.

Epidemiology of Polytrauma at a Teaching Hospital in Northern Ghana: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Seidu, A. S.; Alhassan, A. R.; Buunaaim, Adbi","Background. Polytrauma refers to multiple life-threatening injuries to more than 2 bodily regions with some significant physiologic derangement. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile of polytrauma and outline the distribution of extremity fractures among cases in Northern Ghana. Methods. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tamale Teaching Hospital. Data were extracted using a data collection tool onto MS Excel, cleaned, and exported onto SPSS version 26 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to present data in tables and charts. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess whether there was a significant difference in the mean ISS and mean length of stay of the direct causes of death. Results. About 186 out of 5413 attendants to the emergency department were polytrauma, period prevalence of 3.4%. The male-to-female ratio was 1.9 : 1. Young adults (21-40 years) contributed 64% of the participants. The mean age of participants was 32.9 +/- 15.4 years, and the mean ISS was 40.6 +/- 13.1. Road traffic accidents (68.8%) were the most common cause of polytrauma. The mortality was 33.0%. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was the most common direct cause of mortality (54.1%). There was a significant mean difference (MD) in the length of stay between multiple organ failure (MOF) and TBI (MD = 3.169, 95% C.I. = 0.48-5.86) and between MOF and hemorrhage (MD = 6.212, 95% C.I. = 2.62-9.80). Most fractures were closed (75.3%) and affected the lower limbs (61.5%). Open reduction and internal fixation were the most common surgery for extremity fractures. Conclusion.

Flexor digitorum accessorius longus muscle in resistant clubfoot patients: introduction of a new sign predicting its presence,"Shaheen, S.; Mursal, H.; Rabih, M.; Johari, A.","Clubfoot, talipes equino varus (TEV), is a common congenital foot anomaly. Some cases are resistant to conservative treatment. Many causes of resistance have been reported, among these, the presence of anomalous muscles; however, the effect of the presence of anomalous muscles on the outcome of conservative management is not well studied. These aberrant muscles are discovered during the extensive surgical release as an abnormal finding. The aim of this work is to study the demographic characteristics of patients with resistant TEV that necessitated extensive soft tissue release at Sudan Clubfoot Clinic and to document the prevalence of flexor digitorum accessorius longus (FDAL) muscle in a large series of clubfoot patients treated by extensive surgery: posteromedial release. Also, we introduce a new observation as an indication by which the surgeon can predict the presence of FDAL. On the basis of an observation that there is a special posture of the big toe in extension in relation to other flexed toes associated with the presence of FDAL, records of patients of clubfoot treated by extensive surgery between 2007 and 2012 at the Sudan Clubfoot Project were reviewed. Demographic characteristics were studied. Only patients with idiopathic TEV were included. Resistant clubfeet necessitated extensive release in 261 patients, 197 males and 64 females. Their ages ranged between 1 day and 15 years at presentation. FDAL muscle was found in 48 patients (54 feet) out of 261 patients (411 feet, 13.14%). In 46 of the 48 patients (95.8%), the presence of the FDAL could be predicted by a sign. FDAL is prevalent in 13% of resistant TEV cases requiring extensive soft tissue release, and the surgeon can expect resistant clubfoot and predict the presence of the FDAL in over 95% before he operates by observing the Samir-Adam sign.",2015,,J Pediatr Orthop B,24,2,143-6,25493703,10.1097/bpb.0000000000000129,13735,#7844,Shaheen 2015,Rachel Wangi (2025-02-12 14:26:56)(Select): Gives insights about the burden.

"Geospatial relationship of road traffic crashes and healthcare facilities with trauma surgical capabilities in Nairobi, Kenya: defining gaps in coverage","Shaw, B. I.; Wangara, A. A.; Wambua, G. M.; Kiruja, J.; Dicker, R. A.; Mweu, J. M.; Juillard, C.","BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Access to timely emergency services is needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality of RTIs and other traumatic injuries. Our objective was to describe the distribution of roadtrafficcrashes (RTCs) in Nairobi with the relative distance and travel times for victims of RTCs to health facilities with trauma surgical capabilities. METHODS: RTCs in Nairobi County were recorded by the Ma3route app from May 2015 to October 2015 with latitude and longitude coordinates for each RTC extracted using geocoding. Health facility administrators were interviewed to determine surgical capacity of their facilities. RTCs and health facilities were plotted on maps using ArcGIS. Distances and travel times between RTCs and health facilities were determined using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. RESULTS: 89 percent (25/28) of health facilities meeting inclusion criteria were evaluated. Overall, health facilities were well equipped for trauma surgery with 96% meeting WHO Minimal Safety Criteria. 76 percent of facilities performed greater than 12 of three pre-selected 'Bellweather Procedures' shown to correlate with surgical capability. The average travel time and distance from RTCs to the nearest health facilities surveyed were 7 min and 3.4 km, respectively. This increased to 18 min and 9.6 km if all RTC victims were transported to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). CONCLUSION: Almost all hospitals surveyed in the present study have the ability to care for trauma patients. Treating patients directly at these facilities would decrease travel time compared with transfer to KNH. Nairobi County could benefit from formally coordinating the triage of trauma patients to more facilities to decrease travel time and potentially improve patient outcomes.

Pediatric trauma at a government referral hospital in The Gambia,"Shen, C.; Sanno-Duanda, B.; Bickler, S. W.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the pattern of childhood injuries at a government referral hospital in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: Twenty-nine month hospital based study at the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) in Banjul, The Gambia. Children with injuries were identified from a prospectively recorded pediatric surgery database. Rate of pediatric trauma presenting to RVH was calculated for an urban population of 270,540 (32.3% aged 0-14 years) living within 25 km of the hospital. RESULTS: From January 1996 to June 1998, 798 children aged 0-14 years were admitted for treatment of injuries. Injuries accounted for 4.8% of all pediatric admissions. Burns (38.7%), fractures (20.9%), head injuries (16.2%) and soft tissue injuries (9.4%) were the most common injuries--together responsible for 85% of admissions and 74% of total hospital days. Average length of stay was 20.6 days, with injuries accounting for 16,696 total hospital days. Seventeen percent of injured children required a surgical procedure. The most common surgical procedures were burn contracture release (20%), reduction of fracture and dislocations (20%) and skin grafts (18.7%). In hospital mortality was 5.5%, with 71% of deaths related to burns. The annual cases of trauma presenting to RVH from the Greater Banjul Area was 181 admissions, 3317 hospital days, 28 surgical procedures and 7 deaths per 100,000 children aged 0-14 years.

The organization supports surgeries in several countries that experience high levels of regional conflict and violence. Nigeria, a country where Smile Train is very active, has undergone numerous periods of extreme violence over the past 12 years. The purpose of the present study is to analyze how local violence and conflict have impacted the ability of surgeons partnered with Smile Train to provide care in Nigeria. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed Smile Train Express, the organization's database, from 2003 to 2015 for cleft lip/palate repairs performed in Nigeria. The data was chronologically mapped against a detailed timeline of incidents of violence in Nigeria to compare how violence affected the work of Smile Train-affiliated surgeons. RESULTS: Smile Train-affiliates facilitated 11,499 surgeries in Nigeria from 2003 to 2015. During the same period, 46,370 people were killed in Nigeria in acts of terrorism and violence. Major drops in the frequency of cleft surgeries were preceded by spikes in violence.

Prevalence of Cleft Lip and Palate in the Developing Countries of Asia and Africa: A Review,"Shrestha, A.; Hoang, H.; Gardner, S.; Pradhan, A.; Crocombe, L.","Introduction: The objective of this paper is to review the literature on the incidence of cleft lip and palate (CLP) in the developing countries of Asia and Africa. The existing literature tends to focus on developed countries and there is lack of research in developing countries. Methods: The studies that met the inclusion criteria were reviewed and data extracted. There were 20 studies done in Asian and African countries which were included. Results: The incidence of CLP in Asian countries is markedly greater than in African countries. Most studies report a male predominance in CLPs and a female predominance in cleft palates. The male dominance is seen more than other developing countries which is consistent with other Asian countries and the same has been found in African countries. In the Nepalese study, females were slightly more affected than males among all clefts.

With rapid industrialization, the incidence of hand injuries is expected to rise in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). However, estimates of burden and validated outcome tools are needed for effective resource allocation in the management of these injuries. Study design: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the burden of hand injuries in LMICs according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Methods: We searched PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane Library, PAIS International, African Index Medicus, Global Health, IMMEMR, IMSEAR, Wholis and Bdenf, Lilacs, Scielo, WPRIM, and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform to detect eligible articles with no restrictions on length of follow-up, type of hand injury, or date. Results: We included 17 articles after screening 933 eligible articles based on title, abstract, and full-text screening. There was significant heterogeneity and low quality of evidence. All included articles suggest that hand injuries were associated with work limitations for the majority of patients, and residual pain can further limit their activities. Direct and indirect costs related to treatment account for a major healthcare burden with limited evidence on estimates of long-term cost from disability. Conclusions: The present systematic review highlights the paucity of high-quality data on the epidemiology, management, and burden of hand injuries in LMICs. The data are heterogeneous, and comprehensive metrics are lacking. Because hand injuries can account for a significant proportion of injury-related disability, reducing the overall burden of hand injuries is of utmost importance.",2018,,Public Health,162,,135-146,,10.1016/j.puhe.2018.05.016,18889,#8034,Siotos 2018,Sabina Rodriguez (2025-04-18 05:52:03)(Select): Only extract surgery related variables (cases with surgeries and cost of surgery for hand procedures.; ,Burden; Cost; Injuries

Waiting Too Long: The Contribution of Delayed Surgical Access to Pediatric Disease Burden in Somaliland,"Smith, E. R.; Concepcion, T. L.; Shrime, M.; Niemeier, K.; Mohamed, M.; Dahir, S.; Ismail, E. A.; Poenaru, D.; Rice, H. E.","BACKGROUND: Delayed access to surgical care for congenital conditions in low- and middle-income countries is associated with increased risk of death and life-long disabilities, although the actual burden of delayed access to care is unknown. Our goal was to quantify the burden of disease related to delays to surgical care for children with congenital surgical conditions in Somaliland. METHODS: We collected data from medical records on all children (n = 280) receiving surgery for a proxy set of congenital conditions over a 12-month time period across all 15 surgically equipped hospitals in Somaliland. We defined delay to surgical care for each condition as the difference between the ideal and the actual ages at the time of surgery. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to these delays were calculated and compared by the type of condition, travel distance to care, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: We found long delays in surgical care for these 280 children with congenital conditions, translating to a total of 2970 attributable delayed DALYs, or 8.4 avertable delayed DALYs per child, with the greatest burden among children with neurosurgical and anorectal conditions. Over half of the families seeking surgical care had to travel over 2 h to a surgically equipped hospital in the capital city of Hargeisa. CONCLUSIONS: Children with congenital conditions in Somaliland experience substantial delays to surgical care and travel long distances to obtain care. Estimating the burden of delayed surgical care with avertable delayed DALYs offers a powerful tool for estimating the costs and benefits of interventions to improve the quality of surgical care.",2020,,World journal of surgery,44,3,656-664,,10.1007/s00268-019-05239-w,18081,#8077,Smith 2020,"",Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care; Children / Pediatric Population; Congenital Malformations
"Pattern and factors affecting management outcome of neonatal emergency surgery in Ile-Ife, Nigeria","Sowande, O. A.; Ogundoyin, O. O.; Adejuyigbe, O.","Objective: To determine the pattern and various factors that can affect the outcome of emergency surgical management of the neonate in a developing country. Methods: A retrospective study of all neonates who had emergency surgery over a 10-year period at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Results: There were 72 males and 38 females. The age at presentation ranged between 2 h to 30 days (mean ± SD: 6.62 ± 7.14 days). The weight at presentation was 1.3 to 3.9 kg (mean ± SD: 2.62 ± 0.53 kg). The mean birthweight of the survivors (mean ± SD: 2.84 ± 0.44 kg) was significantly higher than those that died (mean ± SD: 2.26 ± 0.49 kg) (P < 0.01). The mean interval to surgery from onset of symptoms in the survivors (mean ± SD: 42.720 ± 41.769 h) compared well to those that died (mean ± SD: 51.85 ± 65.52 h) (P = 0.424). The admission weight, duration of operation, level of gastrointestinal obstruction and type of operation significantly influenced the outcome. Closure of ruptured exomphalos, thoracostomy with oesophageal anastomosis, and intestinal resection with anastomosis are associated with high mortality. Sepsis/septicaemia was the commonest postoperative complications accounting for 16 deaths. Overall, there were 59 deaths (53.6%). Conclusion: The morbidity and mortality following emergency surgical management of the neonate is still very high in this environment. Lower admission weight, long duration of operation, type of operation performed and presence of upper gastrointestinal obstruction are significantly associated with increased neonatal surgical mortality in our hospital. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong.",2007,,Surgical Practice,11,2,71-75,,10.1111/j.1744-1633.2007.00341.x,22289,#8165,Sowande 2007,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-15 21:57:03)(Select): mainly gastrointestinal anomalies. however; addresses barriers to neonatal surgical care. ; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-15 01:37:59)(Select): Includes reconstructive surgical conditions, ulcer healing and limb amputation; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-15 01:37:14)(Select): The full text id free to read but downloading is disabled; ",Burden; Children / Pediatric Population
Burn care in Africa: reducing the misery index: the 1993 Everett Idris Evans Memorial Lecture,"Sowemimo, G. O.","Burn care in Africa is hampered by inadequate facilities, inadequate infrastructure, and inadequately trained staff. Burn units with burn teams are few. Burn injuries carry a high mortality rate with delayed healing and high complication rates among survivors. Most burns occur in the home from flame and scalding, and children are more affected than adults. Burn sepsis is mostly from staphylococci and pseudomonas. Various studies on epidemiology, sepsis, protein metabolism, and repigmentation indicate methods of prevention and improved care, including greater resort by surgeons to skin grafting, which speeds healing and both prevents and treats scarring, contractures, and depigmentation. Governments, industries, and entrepreneurs are exhorted to promote burn prevention, research, improved care, and rehabilitation, particularly through the establishment of burn units with burn teams, to reduce the misery and suffering caused by the high mortality and morbidity from burns in Africa.",1993,,J Burn Care Rehabil,14,6,589-94,8300693,10.1097/00004630-199311000-00002,13458,#8167,Sowemimo 1993,"",Barriers to Care; Burns; Surgical Capacity
Retrospective review of Surgical Availability and Readiness in 8 African countries,"Spiegel, D. A.; Droti, B.; Relan, P.; Hobson, S.; Cherian, M. N.; O'Neill, K.","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess surgical availability and readiness in 8 African countries using the WHO's Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool. Setting: We analysed data for surgical services, including basic and comprehensive surgery, comprehensive obstetric care, blood transfusion, and infection prevention, obtained from the WHO's SARA surveys in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Mauritania, Benin, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo and Togo. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Among the facilities that were expected to offer surgical services (N=3492), there were wide disparities between the countries in the number of facilities per 100 000 population that reported offering basic surgery (1.0-12.1), comprehensive surgery (0.1-0.8), comprehensive obstetric care (0.1-0.8) and blood transfusion (0.1-0.8). Only 0.1-0.3 facilities per 100 000 population had all three bellwether procedures available, namely laparotomy, open fracture management and caesarean section. In all the countries, the facilities that reported offering surgical services generally had a shortage of the necessary items for offering the services and this varied greatly between the countries, with the facilities having on average 27-53% of the items necessary for offering basic surgery, 56-83% for comprehensive surgery, 49-72% for comprehensive obstetric care and 54-80% for blood transfusion. Furthermore, few facilities had all the necessary items present. However, facilities that reported offering surgical services had on average most of the necessary items for the prevention of infection. Conclusions: There are important gaps in the surgical services in the 8 African countries surveyed.

SETTING: Eight primary HCs in South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: Eight health officers and nurses staffing eight HCs completed a survey. DESIGN: The study was a survey-based, cross-sectional assessment of HCs in South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia and data were collected over a 30-day period from November 2014 to January 2015. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey assessed human and material resources, diagnostic capabilities and challenges and patient-reported barriers to care. RESULTS: Eight HCs had an average of 18 providers each, the majority of which were nurses (62.2%) and health officers (20.7%). HCs had intermittent availability of clean water, nasogastric tubes, rectal tubes and suturing materials, none of them had any form of imaging. A total of 168 surgical patients were seen at the 8 HCs; 58% were referred for surgery. Most common diagnoses were trauma/burns (42%) and need for caesarean section (9%). Of those who did not receive surgery, 32 patients reported specific barriers to obtaining care (91.4%). The most common specific barriers were patients not being decision makers to have surgery, lack of family/social support and inability to afford hospital fees. CONCLUSIONS: HCs in South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia are well-staffed with nurses and health officers, however they face a number of diagnostic and treatment challenges due to lack of material resources. Many patients requiring surgery receive initial diagnosis and care at HCs; sociocultural and financial factors commonly prohibit these patients from receiving surgery.

However, serial assessments to determine the effect of capacity improvements or changes over time have rarely been performed. OBJECTIVE To compare the availability of trauma care resources in Ghana between 2004 and 2014 to assess the effects of a decade of change in the trauma care landscape and derive recommendations for improvements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Capacity assessmentswere performed using direct inspection and structured interviews derived from theWorld Health Organization's Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care. In Ghana, 10 hospitals in 2004 and 32 hospitals in 2014 were purposively sampled to represent those most likely to care for injuries. Clinical staff, administrators, logistic/procurement officers, and technicians/biomedical engineers who interacted, directly or indirectly, with trauma care resources were interviewed at each hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Availability of items for trauma carewas rated from 0 (complete absence) to 3 (fully available). Factors contributing to deficiency in 2014 were determined for items rated lower than 3. Each item rated lower than 3 at a specific hospital was defined as a hospital-item deficiency. Scores for total number of hospital-item deficiencies were derived for each contributing factor. RESULTS There were significant improvements in mean ratings for trauma care resources: district-level (smaller) hospitals had a mean rating of 0.8 for all items in 2004 vs 1.3 in 2014 (P =.002); regional (larger) hospitals had a mean rating of 1.1 in 2004 vs 1.4 in 2014 (P =.01). However, a number of critical deficiencies remain (eg, chest tubes, diagnostics, and orthopedic and neurosurgical care; mean ratings≤2). Leading contributing factors were item absence (503 hospital-item deficiencies), lack of training (335 hospital-item deficiencies), and stockout of consumables (137 hospital-item deficiencies). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There has been significant improvement in trauma care capacity during the past decade in Ghana; however, critical deficiencies remain and require urgent redress to avert preventable death and disability.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study was to determine the prevalence of cleft lip and palate in births taking place in hospitals in the Sudan. METHODS: The records of 15,890 Sudanese new-borns delivered at three hospitals during the period from 1997 to 2000 were examined. RESULTS: Thirteen cases of cleft lip and palate were found, demonstrating a prevalence of 0.9 per 1000. There were more girls than boys, with a male:female ratio of 3:10. Fifty-four per cent of the cases had cleft lip with cleft palate, 30% had only cleft palate and the remaining 16% had cleft lip alone. CONCLUSIONS: The present study was confined to hospital-based births in one city, and the true incidence of cleft lip and/or palate in the Sudan is not yet known.

Determinant Causes of Limb Amputation in Ethiopia: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Sume, B. W.; Geneti, S. A.","BACKGROUND: Most amputees suffered from lack of rehabilitation services and went on streets as glorified beggars. However, there is a paucity of information about determinant causes of amputation in Ethiopia. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled prevalence of limb amputation and its determinant causes in Ethiopian population. METHODS: Worldwide databases such as PubMed/MedLine, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched to retrieve pertinent articles. Grey literatures were also looked in local and national repositories. Microsoft excel was used to extract data which were exported to stata version 14.0 for analysis. Cochrane Q and I(2) tests were used to assess heterogeneity. Egger's and Begg's tests were employed to assess reporting biases. Random effect meta-analysis model was applied to estimate pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-one qualified studies with 18,900 study participants were reviewed. Pooled prevalence of limb amputation was 31.69%. Lower extremity amputation (LEA) accounted for 14.41%, and upper extremity amputation (UEA) took 10.53% (6.50, 14.53). Above knee amputations (2.50 %) were common orthopedic operations whereas ray amputations (0.03%) were the least orthopedic procedures of LEA. Above elbow amputations (2.46%) were common from UEA while shoulder disarticulations (0.02%) were the least orthopedic surgical procedures. The major causes of limb amputations were trauma (11.05%), diabetic foot ulcer (9.93 %), traditional bone setters (24.10%) and burn (10.63%). CONCLUSIONS: Lower extremity amputations were common orthopedic surgical procedures. Major determinant causes were trauma, diabetic foot ulcer, traditional bone setters and burn.",2023,,Ethiop J Health Sci,33,5,891-902,38784515,10.4314/ejhs.v33i5.19,13289,#8327,Sume 2023,"",Burden; Burns; Ulcers

"Bomb blast: imaging findings, treatment and clinical course of extremity traumas","Tahtabasi, M.; Er, S.; Karasu, R.; Ucaroglu, E. R.","Background: To describe the severity and types of blast-related extremity injuries and the presence of accompanying vascular injuries (VI) and amputation, and to identify the associated factors affecting the treatment management and clinical course. Methods: The study included 101 patients with extremity injuries caused by a bomb explosion. The radiographs and computed tomography angiographies of the patients were evaluated in terms of injury patterns, presence of penetrating fragments and fractures, and localization (upper or lower extremity) and type (open or closed) of injury. The Gustilo-Anderson classification was used for open fractures. According to their severity, open fractures classified as types 1 and 2 were included in Group 1 and those classified as type 3A, 3B and 3C in Group 2. Results: As a result of blast exposure, 101 (57.7%) patients had extremity injuries, of which 76 (75.2%) presented with at least one fracture. Of the total of 103 fractures, nine (8.8%) were closed and 94 (91.2%) were open. Thirty-eight (40.4%) of the open fractures were located in the upper extremities, and 56 (59.6%) in the lower extremities and pelvis. Open fractures were most frequently localized in the femur (n = 20; 21.2%), followed by the tibia (n = 18; 19.1%). The majority of patients with open fractures were in Group 1 (71.4%). The duration of hospital stay was longer in Group 2 (12.1 ± 5.8 vs. 6.3 ± 6.7 days, p < 0.0001, respectively). Mortality among patients in Group 2 (45.0%) was significantly higher than in Group 1 (8.0%) (p < 0.0001). Similarly, the injury severity score (ISS) was higher in Group 2 (median 20 vs. 9, p < 0.0001). VI was present in 13 (12.9%) of all patients, and amputation in seven (7.9%). Conclusion: The presence of severe open fractures, VI, and high ISS score can be considered as important factors that increase morbidity and mortality. In extremity traumas, through the secondary blast mechanism, contaminated-fragmented tissue injuries occur. Therefore, we believe that it will be beneficial to apply damage control surgery in places with low socioeconomic level and poor hygienic conditions.",2021,,BMC Emergency Medicine,21,1,,,10.1186/s12873-021-00421-7,17099,#8382,Tahtabasi 2021,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-28 04:02:22)(Select): open-fractures; wound debridement; soft tissue repair; ,""

Design: Face-to-face semi-structured audio recorded interviews were used to obtained qualitative textual data. Thematic analysis using interpretative descriptive techniques was employed to understand the participants’ lived experiences with barriers and accessibility to cleft services. Setting: Participants were from Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara states in remote northwest, Nigeria. Participants: Consisted of 22 caregivers (17 parents and 5 extended family members) were purposively sampled between 2017 and 2020 Main outcome measures: Barriers experienced while accessing cleft services were identified during thematic analysis. Result: Over three quarter of the respondents had patients with both cleft lip and palate and without any previous family history (n = 20). About two-thirds of the participants (n = 15) were females. Most of the interviews were conducted before the surgeries (n = 15). Five themes emerged: lack of information, financial difficulty, misrepresentation from health workers, multiple transportation and previous disappointment. Conclusions: Areas of poor awareness, misinformation from primary health care workers, financial hurdles, multiple transportation logistics and others were identified.

B.; Jumbam, D. T.; Kanmounye, U. S.","INTRODUCTION: the burden of diseases amenable to surgery, obstetrics, trauma, and anesthesia (SOTA) care is increasing globally but low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed National Surgical, Obstetrics, and Anesthesia Plans as national policies to reduce the global SOTA burden. These plans are dependent on comprehensive stakeholder engagement and health policy analysis. Objective: in this study, we analyzed existing national health policies and events in Cameroon to identify opportunities for SOTA policies. METHODS: we searched the Cameroonian Ministry of Health´s health policy database to identify past and current policies. Next, the policies were retrieved and screened for mentions of SOTA-related interventions using relevant keywords in French and English, and analyzed using the 'eight-fold path´ framework for public policy analysis. RESULTS: we identified 136 policies and events and excluded 16 duplicates. The health policies and events included were implemented between 1967 and 2021. Fifty-nine policies and events (49.2%) mentioned SOTA care: governance (n=25), infrastructure (n=21), service delivery (n=11), workforce (n=11), information management (n=10), and funding (n=8). Most policies and events focused on maternal and neonatal health, followed by anesthesia, ophthalmologic surgery, and trauma. National, multinational civil society organizations and private stakeholders supported these policies and events, and the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health was the largest funder. CONCLUSION: most Cameroonian SOTA-related policies and events focus on maternal and neonatal care, and health financing is the health system component with the least policies and events.

Methodology: This retrospective study describes paediatric surgical admissions in a Nigerian teaching hospital between January 1998 and December 2002. Results: Two hundred and eighty three children up to 15 years of age with surgical disorders were studied. Their mean age (± SD) was 5.8 ± 4 years for males and 6.9 ± 4 years for females. Length of stay (LOS) ranged from 1 to 127 days (mean 17 days). Turnover interval declined from 22.1 to 6.4 days while percentage bed occupancy and patients per bed per year averaged 70% and 17.4 respectively between January 2000 and December 2002. The highest mean LOS was due to malignant neoplasm (38 ± 12 days), trauma (22 ± 25) and surgical infection (21 ± 22 days) while the shortest mean LOS was due to foreign body (6 ± 4 days). The most common admitting diagnoses were trauma (36.7%), congenital anomalies (27.9%) and surgical infections (22.6%).

F.; Situma, M.; Kakembo, N.; Ozgediz, D. E.; Sabatini, C. S.","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic injury is responsible for eight million childhood deaths annually. In Uganda, there is a paucity of comprehensive data describing the burden of pediatric trauma, which is essential for resource allocation and surgical workforce planning. This study aimed to ascertain the burden of non-adolescent pediatric trauma across four Ugandan hospitals. METHODS: We performed a descriptive review of four independent and prospective pediatric surgical databases in Uganda: Mulago National Referral Hospital (2012-2019), Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (2015-2019), Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) (2016-2019), and St Mary's Hospital Lacor (SMHL) (2016-2019). We sub-selected all clinical encounters that involved trauma. The primary outcome was the distribution of injury mechanisms. Secondary outcomes included operative intervention and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There was a total of 693 pediatric trauma patients, across four hospital sites: Mulago National Referral Hospital (n = 245), Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (n = 29), SRRH (n = 292), and SMHL (n = 127). The majority of patients were male (63%), with a median age of 5 [interquartile range = 2, 8]. Chiefly, patients suffered blunt injury mechanisms, including falls (16.2%) and road traffic crashes (14.7%) resulting in abdominal trauma (29.4%) and contusions (11.8%). At SRRH and SMHL, from which orthopedic data were available, 27% of patients suffered long-bone fractures. Overall, 55% of patients underwent surgery and 95% recovered to discharge.

Effective management improves outcomes; however, the availability of necessary resources in LMICs remains unclear. We evaluated surgical centres in LMICs using the WHO Surgical Assessment Tool (SAT) to identify opportunities to optimize paediatric burn care. Methods: We reviewed WHO SAT database entries for 2010-2015. A total of 1121 facilities from 57 countries met the inclusion criteria: facilities with surgical capacity in LMICs operating on children. Human resources, equipment and infrastructure relevant to paediatric burn care were analysed by WHO Regional and World Bank Income Classifications and facility type. Results: Facilities had an average of 147 beds and performed 485 paediatric operations annually. Discrepancies existed between procedures performed and resource availability; 86% of facilities performed acute burn care, but only 37% could consistently provide intravenous fluids. Many, particularly tertiary, centres performed contracture release and skin grafting (41%) and amputation (50%). Conclusions: LMICs have limited resources to provide paediatric burn care but widely perform many interventions necessary to address the burden of burns.

M.; Belachew, A.; Mulatu, S.; Desie, T.; Abate, M. W.; Nigat, A. B.; Tibebu, N. S.; Walle, B. G.; Tigabu, A.; Belete, A.","Introduction: Burn is a severe type of traumatic injury, which can lead to deformity, disability, or death, and remains a significant health problem worldwide. It is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among Ethiopian children, as many hospitals are lacking a well-equipped and prepared burn center. Children under the age of 15 are at increased risk of burn-related complications. Because they may not be able to escape from the burning object, they often experience a long duration of contact with the hot substance, with a resultant deep burn injury and death. Methods: Institutional cross-sectional study was used to study 375 hospitalized burn injury survivor pediatrics from 2015 to 2019. A simple random sampling method was used to select participants. Data were exported from Epidata version 4.6 to SPSS version 25 for analysis. In multivariable analysis, significant of the variables were considered at p-value of <= 0.05. Results: In total, 353 were included in the study. Of 353 burn injury survivors, the prevalence of pathological scar was 125 (35.4%). In multivariable analysis, depth of bum injury, time since bum injury, a patient who have a referred to physiotherapy by the surgeon, and surgical procedure is done after burn were statistically significant with a complication of burn injury survivors. Conclusion and Recommendation: This study revealed that the burden of pathological scar among survivors of burn injury was unacceptably high, which needs intervention from the concerned bodies. Since this high burden of complication might result from the limitation of applying Interburn recommendation, the Amhara regional health bureau and the South Gondar health department shall work in collaboration with Interburn to provide essential burn care and advanced burn care training for health care providers. The timely intervention of those who have a second- and third-degree burn, promoting early presentation to hospital, providing appropriate physiotherapy, and proper care for those who have surgical intervention may help to decrease pathological scar for burn victim children.",2021,,Chronic Wound Care Manag.

Cleft lip-cleft palate in Zimbabwe: estimating the distribution of the surgical burden of disease using geographic information systems,"Tollefson, T. T.; Shaye, D.; Durbin-Johnson, B.; Mehdezadeh, O.; Mahomva, L.; Chidzonga, M.","OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To evaluate the prevalence and unmet need for cleft lip-cleft palate reconstructive surgery by using incidence. Our hypotheses were that the age of presentation to screening clinics will decrease between 2006 and 2012, and the geospatial distribution of cases will expand to a more rural catchment area. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cross-sectional/geospatial distribution study. METHODS: An online, secure database was created from intake forms for children with cleft lip-cleft palate (N=604) in Zimbabwe (2006-2012). Univariate analysis was completed. A linear regression model was fitted to test the time trend of a child's age at the time of presentation. Unique patient addresses (n=411) were matched. Maps presenting cleft diagnosis and presentation year were created with geographic information systems (GIS) software. RESULTS: The median age of presentation was greater for isolated cleft palate (4.2 years, n=106) than isolated cleft lip (1.5 years, n=251) and cleft lip-cleft palate (2.0 years, n=175). Cleft lip cases were mostly left sided with equal gender distribution. The overall age of presentation remained stable (P=.83). The age of children with isolated cleft palate decreased by 0.8 years per surgical trip (P=.01), suggesting the prevalence of unrepaired cleft palate is decreasing due to local and visiting surgeons. The catchment area extended to a less populous area, but clustered around Harare and Bulawayo. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives Zimbabwe-specific evidence that supports reports of the persistent burden of disease requiring attention. The GIS software provided data for the primary needs assessment, which will direct communication to healthcare providers and prospective patients outside of the current catchment area.

Rural communities have limited access to high quality health services-based wound care. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study on wound management at three levels– community (C), health centre (HC), district hospital (DH)—in a rural community of Côte d’Ivoire. Patients with skin wounds actively identified in a house-to-house survey and pas-sively in the health services in a defined area of the Taabo Health and Demographic Surveillance System were asked to participate and followed-up longitudinally. Endpoints were proportion of wounds closed, time to wound closure, wound size over time, frequency of secondary bacterial infection, need for recapturing after follow-up interruption, and duration of treatment stratified by health service level and wound aetiology. Results We enrolled 561 patients with 923 wounds between May 2019 and March 2020. The observation period ended in March 2021. Median age was 10 years (IQR 7–15), 63.0% of patients were male. Almost all (99.5%, 870/874) wounds closed within the observation period, 5.3% (49/923) were lost to follow-up. Wounds primarily treated in C, HC and DH closed within a median time of 10, 16 and 170 days, respectively. Median time to acute wound and chronic wound closure was 13 and 72 days, respectively.

The scale of the problem including preventable progression to chronic wounds, disability and systemic complications is largely unaddressed. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study combining active (household-based survey) and passive case finding (health services-based survey) to determine the burden and clinical epidemiology of wounds within the Taabo Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in rural Côte d’Ivoire. Patients identified with wounds received free care and were invited to participate in the wound management study simultaneously carried out in the survey area. The data were analysed for wound prevalence, stratified by wound and patient characteristics. Results 3842 HDSS-registered persons were surveyed. Overall wound prevalence derived from combined active and passive case finding was 13.0%. 74.1% (403/544) of patients were below the age of 15 years. Most frequent aetiologies were mechanical trauma (85.3%), furuncles (5.1%), burns (2.9%) and Buruli ulcer (2.2%). Most wounds were acute and smaller than 5 cm2 in size. 22.0% (176/799) of wounds showed evidence of secondary bacterial infection. 35.5% (22/62) of chronic wounds had persisted entirely neglected for years. Buruli ulcer prevalence was 2.3 per 1000 individuals and considerably higher than expected from an annual incidence of 0.01 per 1000 individuals as reported by WHO for Côte d’Ivoire at the time of the study. Conclusions Skin wounds are highly prevalent in rural West Africa, where they represent a widely neglected problem. The HDSS-based survey with combined active and passive case finding adopted in this study provides a better estimate than school- and health institution-based surveys which underestimate the frequency of skin wounds and, particularly, of neglected tropical diseases of the skin, such as Buruli ulcer and yaws.

Survival after burn in a sub-Saharan burn unit: Challenges and opportunities,"Tyson, A. F.; Boschini, L. P.; Kiser, M. M.; Samuel, J. C.; Mjuweni, S. N.; Cairns, B. A.; Charles, A. G.","Background Burns are among the most devastating of all injuries and a major global public health crisis, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, aggressive management of burns continues to lower overall mortality and increase lethal total body surface area (TBSA) at which 50% of patients die (LA50). However, lack of resources and inadequate infrastructure significantly impede such improvements in developing countries. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the burn center at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi between June 2011 and December 2012. We collected information including patient age, gender, date of admission, mechanism of injury, time to presentation to hospital, total body surface area (TBSA) burn, comorbidities, date and type of operative procedures, date of discharge, length of hospital stay, and survival. We then performed bivariate analysis and logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with increased mortality. Results A total of 454 patients were admitted during the study period with a median age of 4 years (range 0.5 months to 79 years). Of these patients, 53% were male. The overall mean TBSA was 18.5%, and average TBSA increased with age - 17% for 0-18 year olds, 24% for 19-60 year olds, and 41% for patients over 60 years old. Scald and flame burns were the commonest mechanisms, 52% and 41% respectively, and flame burns were associated with higher mortality. Overall survival in this population was 82%; however survival reduced with increasing age categories (84% in patients 0-18 years old, 79% in patients 19-60 years old, and 36% in patients older than 60 years). TBSA remained the strongest predictor of mortality after adjusting for age and mechanism of burn. The LA50 for this population was 39% TBSA. Discussion Our data reiterate that burn in Malawi is largely a pediatric disease and that the high burn mortality and relatively low LA50 have modestly improved over the past two decades. The lack of financial resources, health care personnel, and necessary infrastructure will continue to pose a significant challenge in this developing nation.

Delegating some surgical tasks to non-physician clinical officers can mitigate the dependence of a health system on highly skilled clinicians for specific services. METHODS: We performed a case-control study examining pediatric surgical cases over a 12 month period. Operating surgeon was categorized as physician or clinical officer. Operative acuity, surgical subspecialty, and outcome were then compared between the two groups, using physicians as the control. RESULTS: A total of 1186 operations were performed on 1004 pediatric patients. Mean age was 6 years (±5) and 64% of patients were male. Clinical officers performed 40% of the cases. Most general surgery, urology and congenital cases were performed by physicians, while most ENT, neurosurgery, and burn surgery cases were performed by clinical officers. Reoperation rate was higher for patients treated by clinical officers (17%) compared to physicians (7.1%), although this was attributable to multiple burn surgical procedures. Physician and clinical officer cohorts had similar complication rates (4.5% and 4.0%, respectively) and mortality rates (2.5% and 2.1%, respectively). DISCUSSION: Fundamental changes in health policy in Africa are imperative as a significant increase in the number of surgeons available in the near future is unlikely. Task-shifting from surgeons to clinical officers may be useful to provide coverage of basic surgical care.",2014,,Int J Surg,12,5,509-15,24560846,10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.02.009,13450,#8707,Tyson 2014,"",Surgical Capacity
Zygomatic complex fractures in a suburban Nigerian population,"Ugboko, V.; Udoye, C.; Ndukwe, K.; Amole, A.; Aregbesola, S.","A retrospective analysis of 128 zygomatic complex fractures was undertaken. There were 109 males (85.2%) and 19 females (14.8%), aged 3-74 years (mean ± SD, 33 ± 12.6 years). Patients in the third decade of life (38.3%) recorded the highest incidence. Road traffic accidents (74.2%) mainly from automobile (61.7%) and motorcycle (9.4%) involvement were the predominant etiology. While 38.8% of them presented within the first 24 h, males were relatively earlier than their female counterparts, although this was not statistically significant (P > 0.05). Class 3 fractures were the commonest (50%), followed by classes 2 (zygomatic arch) and 4, respectively. Most class 6 fractures (6.3%) resulted from gunshot injuries. There were 116 unilateral (left 63, right 53) and 12 bilateral fractures with the right side of the face recording more zygomatic arch fractures. In addition, statistical significance was observed between etiology, class and type of fracture (P < 0.05). One hundred and twenty-four (136 fractures) patients were available for treatment as four declined. Twelve cases did not require treatment while others were managed by either closed or open reduction under general anesthesia. Gillies' temporal approach was the commonest (57.1%) surgical technique employed. However the unstable nature of the fractures necessitated open reduction and transosseous wiring in 33 cases. The high prevalence of zygomatic complex fractures arising from vehicular accidents reflects the poor status of the road network in rural and suburban Nigerian communities. Hence government should improve on existing infrastructures, decongest the highways and enforce traffic laws amongst road users. In addition, the need to encourage massive investments in safer alternative transport systems is emphasized. © Blackwell Munksgaard, 2005.",2005,,Dental Traumatology,21,2,70-75,,10.1111/j.1600-9657.2004.00275.x,22498,#8739,Ugboko 2005,"",Fractures; Maxillo-facial surgery; Road Traffic Accidents
Facial injuries caused by animals in northern Nigeria,"Ugboko, V. I.; Olasoji, H. O.; Ajike, S. O.; Amole, A. O. D.; Ogundipe, O. T.","We did a retrospective survey of 34 patients who sustained facial injuries after animal associated incidents and presented to three Nigerian teaching hospitals. There were 27 male (79%) and 7 female patients, whose ages ranged from 6 to 40 years. Sixteen (47%) were less than 15 years. Cows (n = 14), camels (n = 9), and donkeys (n = 6) were the most commonly involved. Three dog bites were seen. Knocks from cows' horns (n = 9) were the predominant mechanism of injury, followed by falls (n = 8) and kicks (n = 7). There were many facial lacerations and fractures, and the cheek (n = 14), forehead (n = 13), and chin (n = 10) were the most common sites of soft tissue injury. All injuries were considered to be contaminated irrespective of the duration of the injury. Treatment consisted of thorough debridement and irrigation, primary closure where feasible, and secondary reconstruction in others. All patients were given prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics. Overall, outcome was satisfactory except for a few cases of scar formation, facial nerve palsy, and partial laryngeal stenosis. Associated injuries were recorded in nine cases (27%), with rupture of the globe in three patients (9%). One patient died of associated abdominal injuries after being trampled by a herd of cattle.

K.; Egbikuadje, D. E.; Majekodunmi, A.","Background: Burns in the neonate are rare and result mostly from iatrogenic sources in developed countries. The socioeconomic settings of developing countries are different from those in the developed countries. A review of the epidemiology and management of burns in the neonates in Lagos, Nigeria is presented. Methods: The case notes of burns in patients less than 29 days-old from 2004 to 2008 in 4 tertiary health institutions in Lagos were retrieved from the Medical Records Department; necessary data were extracted and analyzed. Results: There were 21 neonates with burns within the study period. The incidence of neonatal burns ranged between 0.5 and 2.5%/year. The mean age was 16.38 ± 1.84 days and the mean BSA of 26.00 ± 5.53%. The etiology of burns was thermal in 19(90.5%) and chemical in 2(9.5%). Hypokalemia was common at early stages of their treatment. Burns were sustained at home in 90.5% of the cases. The mortality rate was 43.5%. Inhalation and thermal injuries were associated with most of the deaths. Conclusion: Domestic incidents from flames are the commonest causes of neonatal burns in the study environment. These are associated with prolonged morbidity and high mortality rate. Health education, highlighting methods of prevention should be undertaken in the community. Well equipped burn centers should be established to treat burns in all age groups. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd and ISBI.

Burden of diabetic foot ulcer in Nigeria: Current evidence from the multicenter evaluation of diabetic foot ulcer in Nigeria,"Ugwu, E.; Adeleye, O.; Gezawa, I.; Okpe, I.; Enamino, M.; Ezeani, I.","BACKGROUND Nigeria bears the greatest burden of diabetes prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes. Significant improvements in diabetic foot incidence and outcomes have been recorded in many Western countries in the past decade. However, the current burden of DFU in Nigeria is largely unknown. AIM To evaluate the patients’ profile, ulcer characteristics, associated co-morbidities and outcome of patients with DFU in Nigeria. METHODS Multicenter evaluation of diabetic foot ulcer in Nigeria was a one year multicenter observational study of patients hospitalized for DFU in six tertiary health institutions in Nigeria from March 2016 to March 2017. Demographic and diabetes information, ulcer characteristics and associated co-morbidities were assessed. Relevant laboratory and imaging studies were performed. All patients received appropriate multi-disciplinary care and were followed up until discharge or death. Outcome variables of interest were ulcer healing, lower extremity amputation (LEA), duration of hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS A total of 336 patients (55.1% male) with mean age of 55.9 ± 12.5 years were enrolled into this study. Majority (96.1%) had type 2 diabetes. Only 25.9% of the subjects had prior foot care knowledge. Most of the subjects presented late to the hospital and median (IQR) duration of ulcer at presentation was 39 (28-54) d. Ulcers were already advanced (Wagner grades ≥ 3) in 79.2% of the subjects while 76.8% of the ulcers were infected at the time of admission. The commonest co-morbidities were systemic hypertension, anemia and hyperglycemic emergencies. One hundred and nineteen subjects (35.4%) suffered LEA while 10.4% left against medical advice. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalization was 52.0 (29-66) d with case fatality rate of 20.5%. CONCLUSION The burden of DFU in Nigeria is very high. The major gaps include low level of foot care knowledge among diabetic patients, overdependence on self-medication and unorthodox medicine following development of foot ulceration, late hospital presentation, and high amputation and mortality rates. Extensive foot care education within the framework of a multi-disciplinary foot care team is highly desirable.",2019,,World Journal of Diabetes,10,3,200-211,,10.4239/wjd.v10.i3.200,18592,#8751,Ugwu 2019,"Lionel Bernard Dumont (2025-02-24 19:30:18)(Select): agree with Camille , however, skin grafting was clearly mentionned as an option for treatment.

Fournier's gangrene -- analysis of management and outcome in south-eastern Nigeria,"Ugwumba, F. O.; Nnabugwu, II; Ozoemena, O. F.","BACKGROUND: Fournier's gangrene is a necrotising fasciitis of the genitalia and perineum, with associated polymicrobial infection and risk of organ failure or death. The purpose of this study was to determine the presentation, systemic and local predisposing factors, management challenges and outcome in south-eastern Nigeria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 28 out of 34 consecutive male patients with complete case notes seen in two centres (the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital and St Mary's Hospital) between January 1995 and December 2008. Operating theatre registers and urology ward admission registers were used to identify patients. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 48.3 years (range 28 - 66 years), with a peak age incidence of 50 - 59 years. The majority of patients were farmers, manual labourers and artisans. The site of gangrene was scrotal in 22 patients (78.6%), penoscrotal in 3 (10.7%), abdominoscrotal in 2 (7.1%) and scroto-perianal in 1 (3.6%). The mean interval between onset of symptoms and presentation was 7.2 days (range 3 - 14 days). Systemic predisposing factors identified were diabetes mellitus in 6 patients (21.4%), filariasis in 2 (7.2%), congestive cardiac failure in 1 (3.6%) and HIV infection in 1 (3.6%). In 18 patients (64.3%) no systemic factor was identified. Local predisposing factors identified were chronic scrotal skin itching in 16 patients (57.1%), scrotal thorn injury in 2 (7.1%) and urethral catheterisation in 2 (7.1%). Scrotal carbuncle and scrotal surgery each accounted for 2 patients (7.1%), and zipper injury and ischiorectal abscess occurred in 1 patient each (3.6%). No local predisposing factor was identified in 1 patient (3.6%). The common clinical features were fever, scrotal swelling/pain, and later a malodorous painless wound. Treatment involved fluid administration, correction of electrolyte imbalance, antibiotics, debridement and daily wound inspection/dressing with hydrogen peroxide soaks and sodium hypochlorite. The mean duration of hospital stay was 37.1.days (range 21 - 84 days). One patient died (3.6%). CONCLUSION: Fournier's gangrene is a challenging surgical problem, with significant morbidity. Diabetes mellitus is a significant systemic risk factor. In the majority of our cases, no systemic predisposing factor was identified. Local risk factors, especially chronic scrotal itching, were contributory.

C.; Nwafor, C. C.; Oshi, D. C.; Madichie, N. O.; Ekeke, N.; Njoku, M.; Ntana, K.","Background: Buruli ulcer (BU), also known as Mycobacterium ulcerans disease, is the third most common mycobacterial disease worldwide. Although BU disease has been diagnosed among Nigerians in neighbouring West African countries, data on the burden of the disease in Nigeria itself are scanty. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and epidemiology of BU in the South South region of Nigeria. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the Ogoja territory (comprising 31 communities). We undertook sensitisation programmes centred on BU in 10 of the communities. Participants were asked to identify community members with long-standing ulcers, who were then invited for evaluation. We also contacted traditional healers to refer their clients who had non-healing ulcers. All suspected cases had a full clinical evaluation and laboratory testing. Confirmed cases were given treatment in a referral hospital in the territory. Results: We diagnosed 41 clinical BU cases; 36 (87.8 %) of which were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). These 36 PCR-confirmed cases were diagnosed in a total population of 192,169 inhabitants. Therefore, the estimated crude prevalence of BU was 18.7 per 100,000 population, varying from 6.0 to 41.4 per 100,000 in the districts surveyed. The majority (66.7 %) of the cases were females. About 92 % of the BU lesions were located on the patients' extremities. No differences were observed between the sexes in terms of the location of the lesions. The age of the patients ranged from four to 60 years, with a median age of 17 years. All 35 (100 %) patients who consented to treatment completed chemotherapy as prescribed. Of the treated cases, 29 (82.9 %) needed and received surgery. All cases healed, but 29 (82.9 %) had some limitations in movement. Healing with limitations in movement occurred in 18/19 (94.7 %) and 8/10 (80.0 %) of patients with lesions >15 cm (Category III) and 6-15 cm in diameter (Category II), respectively. The median duration of treatment was 130 (87-164) days for children and 98 (56-134) days for adults (p = 0.15). Conclusions: In Nigeria, BU is endemic but its severity is underestimated-at least in the study setting. There is a need to identify and map BU endemic regions in Nigeria. A comprehensive BU control programme is also urgently needed.",2016,,Infectious Diseases of Poverty,5,1,,,10.1186/s40249-016-0119-8,19924,#8762,Ukwaja 2016,Lionel Bernard Dumont (2025-03-06 18:31:57)(Select): data related to reconstructive surgery.

Implementation of a contextually appropriate pediatric emergency surgical care course in Uganda,"Ullrich, S.; Kisa, P.; Ruzgar, N.; Okello, I.; Oyania, F.; Kayima, P.; Kakembo, N.; Sekabira, J.; Situma, M.; Ozgediz, D.","Background: Low- and middle-income countries like Uganda face a severe shortage of pediatric surgeons. Most children with a surgical emergency are treated by nonspecialist rural providers. We describe the design and implementation of a locally driven, pilot pediatric emergency surgical care course to strengthen skills of these providers. This is the first description of such a course in the current literature. Methods: The course was delivered three times from 2018 to 2019. Modules include perioperative management, neonatal emergencies, intestinal emergencies, and trauma. A baseline needs assessment survey was administered. Participants in the second and third courses also took pre and postcourse knowledge-based tests. Results: Forty-five providers representing multiple cadres participated. Participants most commonly perform hernia/hydrocele repair (17% adjusted rating) in their current practice and are least comfortable managing cleft lip and palate (mean Likert score 1.4 ± 0.9). Equipment shortage was identified as the most significant challenge to delivering pediatric surgical care (24%). Scores on the knowledge tests improved significantly from pre- (55.4% ± 22.4%) to postcourse (71.9% ± 14.0%, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Nonspecialist clinicians are essential to the pediatric surgical workforce in LMICs. Short, targeted training courses can increase provider knowledge about the management of surgical emergencies. The course has spurred local surgical outreach initiatives.

A.; Grp, Pressco Study","Background Understanding the burden of diseases requiring surgical care at national levels is essential to advance universal health coverage. The PREvalence Study on Surgical COnditions (PRESSCO) 2020 is a cross-sectional household survey to estimate the prevalence of physical conditions needing surgical consultation, to investigate healthcare-seeking behavior, and to assess changes from before the West African Ebola epidemic. Methods This study (ISRCTN: 12353489) was built upon the Surgeons Overseas Surgical Needs Assessment (SOSAS) tool, including expansions. Seventy-five enumeration areas from 9671 nationwide clusters were sampled proportional to population size. In each cluster, 25 households were randomly assigned and visited. Need for surgical consultations was based on verbal responses and physical examination of selected household members. Results A total of 3,618 individuals from 1,854 households were surveyed. Compared to 2012, the prevalence of individuals reporting one or more relevant physical conditions was reduced from 25 to 6.2% (95% CI 5.4-7.0%) of the population. One-in-five conditions rendered respondents unemployed, disabled, or stigmatized. Adult males were predominantly prone to untreated surgical conditions (9.7 vs. 5.9% women; p < 0.001). Financial constraints were the predominant reason for not seeking care. Among those seeking professional health care, 86.7% underwent surgery. Conclusion PRESSCO 2020 is the first surgical needs household survey which compares against earlier study data. Despite the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak, which profoundly disrupted the national healthcare system, a substantial reduction in reported surgical conditions was observed. Compared to one-time measurements, repeated household surveys yield finer granular data on the characteristics and situations of populations in need of surgical treatment.",2022,,World J.Surg.,46,11,2585-2594,WOS:000850379800003,10.1007/s00268-022-06695-7,23973,#8841,vanKesteren 2022,Saidu Ahmad Idris (2025-01-23 07:32:00)(Select): Include the prevalence of hard/soft masses and burn cases.; Sabina Rodriguez (2025-01-23 04:47:55)(Select): Reports on surgical conditions and does provide stratification (at least specification of which condition); ,Barriers to Care; Burden

This article describes the care of >80 burn victims at a rural hospital in Kenya, Nakuru Provincial General Hospital, and provides lessons for care of a large number of burned patients in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: Data were obtained from retrospective review from hospital registers and patient files. RESULTS: Treatment was provided for 89 victims. Eighty-six (97%) were men; median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR], 19-32). Half of the patients (45) died, the majority (31, 69%) within the first week. The median total body surface area burned for those who died was 80% (IQR, 60-90%) compared with 28% (IQR, 15-43%) for those who survived (p < 0.001). Twenty patients were transfused a total of 73 units of blood including one patient who received 9 units. Eighty surgical interventions were performed on 31 patients and included 39 split-thickness skin grafts, 21 debridements, 7 escharotomies, 6 dressing changes, 4 contracture releases, and 3 finger amputations. Of the 44 survivors, 39 (89%) were discharged within 4 months of the event. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality after mass burn disasters is high in Africa.

Paediatric surgical conditions in Malawi - A cross-sectional nationwide household survey,"Varela, C.; Viste, A.; Young, S.; Groen, R. S.; Banza, L.; Nandi, B.; Mkandawire, N.; Moen, B. E.","Background Untreated surgical conditions may lead to lifelong disability in children. Treating children with surgical conditions may reduce long-term effects of morbidity and disability. Unfortunately, low- and middle-income countries have limited resources for paediatric surgical care. Malawi, for example, has very few paediatric surgeons. There are also significantly inadequate infrastructures and personnel to treat these children. In order to strengthen resources that could provide such services, we need to begin by quantifying the need. Aim To estimate the approximate prevalence of surgical conditions among children in Malawi, to describe the anatomical locations and diagnoses of the conditions and the presence of injuries. Methods A cross-sectional, nationwide survey of surgical needs was performed in 28 of 29 districts of Malawi. Villages, households and household members were randomly selected. A total of 1487 households were visited and 2960 persons were interviewed. This paper is a sub analysis of the children in the dataset. Information was obtained from 255 living children and inquiry from household respondents for the 255 children who had died in the past year. The interviews were conducted by medical students over a 60-day period, and the validated SOSAS tool was used for data collection. Results There were 67 out of 255 (26.3%) total children living with a surgical condition at the time of the study, with most of the conditions located in the extremities. Half of the children lived with problems due to injuries. Traffic accidents were the most common cause. Two-thirds of the children living with a surgical condition had some kind of disability, and one-third of them were grossly disabled. There were 255 total deceased children, with 34 who died from a surgical condition. The most prevalent causes of death were congenital anomalies of the abdomen, groin and genital region. Conclusion An extrapolation of the 26% of children found to be living with a surgical condition indicates that there could be 2 million children living with a condition that needs surgical consultation or treatment in Malawi. Congenital anomalies cause significant numbers of deaths among Malawian children. Children living with surgical conditions had disorders in their extremities, causing severe disability.

Paediatric surgery and anaesthesia in south-western Uganda: A cross-sectional survey,"Walker, I. A.; Obua, A. D.; Mouton, F.; Ttendo, S.; Wilson, I. H.","Objective To study paediatric surgery rates in south-western Uganda, compare them to rates in England, and determine if existing surgical facilities and workforce meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Methods To obtain information on surgical facilities and workforce, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of all hospitals performing major surgery in 14 districts of south-western Uganda in 2007-2008. Using theatre logbook data, we determined the surgical rates, types of surgery performed and in-theatre surgical outcomes. Findings Of 72 hospitals surveyed, 29 were performing major surgery. None met WHO standards for essential surgery. There were 0.7 accredited surgeons per 100 000 population and no paediatric surgeons. Most anaesthetists were not physicians (accredited anaesthetist per 100 000 population: 1.1). The annual surgical rate for children aged ≤ 14 years was 180 operations per 100 000 population; most were emergency procedures. The annual surgical rate for patients of all ages was 652 operations per 100 000 population, with a median of 422 per operating theatre (range: 60-3497) and of 226 per surgeon (range: 60-1748). Mission or nongovernmental organization (NGO) hospitals, which had 44% of the hospital beds in the region, performed 3039 (55%) of the paediatric operations. Externally funded surgeons performed 80% of the 140 cleft lip and palate operations. Four in-theatre deaths occurred in children ≤ 14 years old (in-theatre mortality: 7.7 deaths per 10 000 operations). Conclusion Access to all surgery, including paediatric surgery, is poor in south-western Uganda and investment in basic health-care facilities and surgical workforce and training is urgently needed. Mission and NGO hospitals make a valuable contribution to elective surgery, and externally funded surgeons make an important contribution to specialist surgery.

Methods We conducted a descriptive study of 47 patients presenting with chaff cutter hand injuries at our center in one year. Results They were predominantly male (98%) and the majority (70%) were aged between 21 and 40 years. The majority of patients who had not resumed work were those with severe injuries and those who had had an amputation. There was a positive correlation between age category and severity of injury. Discussion Chaff cutter injuries contribute considerably to hand amputations at our center. The majority of patients with severe injuries and those undergoing amputations do not return to gainful activities one year after sustaining the injury, suggesting increased dependency. Further research is paramount to identify safety features of chaff cutters in this region.",2022,,F1000Res,11,,1255,37928806,10.12688/f1000research.126590.1,13288,#9023,Wanjara 2022,"Sabina Rodriguez (2025-02-13 08:43:30)(Select): Mentions debridement of wounds, but no main focus on the reconstructive surgery.; ",""
The Current State of Cleft Care in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Narrative Review,"Wester, J. R.; Weissman, J. P.; Reddy, N. K.; Chwa, E. S.; Gosain, A. K.","Objective To identify practices and limitations of cleft care in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Design A retrospective narrative nonsystematic literature review was performed. Setting Literature exploring the management practices of cleft lip and/or palate across regions in SSA was included. Participants Full text case reports, retrospective studies, prospective studies, clinical trials, and review articles written and published in English between 1966 and February 1, 2021, were included in this analysis utilizing PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google scholar databases. Main Outcome Measures Qualitative themes identified in analysis were clinical practice patterns, current infrastructure and limitations of cleft repair, training and interdisciplinary teams, economic analyses, and international partnerships. Results Significant barriers to care identified in SSA include lack of hospital resources, craniofacial training, access to multidisciplinary specialists, and public awareness. These problems make the entire care journey difficult for patients. Increasing public education has the power to diminish late presentations to hospitals. Providing adequate hospital resources and craniofacial training through international and organizational partnerships can ensure that more patients will receive care. Increasing the availability and number of multidisciplinary specialists is crucial to follow up care which aims at improving functional outcomes. Conclusion This narrative review highlights current practices and limitations in cleft care, emphasizing the importance of effective and timely repair of clefts in SSA. Targeted efforts aimed at establishing sustainable infrastructure for cleft care in SSA can have significant individual and community health and economic benefits.",2022,,Cleft Palate-Craniofac.

"Access to care following injury in Northern Malawi, a comparison of travel time estimates between Geographic Information System and community household reports","Whitaker, J.; Brunelli, G.; Van Boeckel, T. P.; Dube, A.; Amoah, A. S.; Rickard, R. F.; Leather, A. J. M.; Davies, J.","INTRODUCTION: Injuries disproportionately impact low- and middle-income countries like Malawi. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery's indicators include the population proportion accessing laparotomy and open fracture care, key trauma interventions, within two hours. The ""Golden Hour"" for receiving facility-based resuscitation also guides injury care system strengthening. Firstly, we estimated the proportion of the local population able to reach primary, secondary and tertiary facility care within two and one hours using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis. Secondly, we compared community household-reported with GIS-estimated travel time. METHODS: Using information from a Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (Karonga, Malawi) on road network, facility location, and local staff-estimated travel speeds, we used a GIS-generated friction surface to calculate the shortest travel time from all households to each facility serving the population. We surveyed community households who reported travel time to their preferred, closest, government secondary and tertiary facilities. For recently injured community members, time to reach facility care was recorded. To assess the relationship between community household-reported travel time and GIS-estimated travel time, we used linear regression to generate a proportionality constant. To assess associations and agreement between injured patient-reported and GIS-estimated travel time, we used Kendall rank and Cohen's kappa tests. RESULTS: Using GIS, we estimated 79.1% of households could reach any secondary facility, 20.5% the government secondary facility, and 0% the government tertiary facility, within two hours. Only 28.2% could reach any secondary facility within one hour, 0% for the government secondary facility. Community household-reported travel time exceeded GIS-estimated travel time. The proportionality constant was 1.25 (95%CI 1.21-1.30) for the closest facility, 1.28 (95%CI 1.23-1.34) for the preferred facility, 1.45 (95%CI 1.33-1.58) for the government secondary facility, and 2.12 (95%CI 1.84-2.41) for tertiary care. Comparing injured patient-reported with GIS-estimated travel time, the correlation coefficient was 0.25 (SE 0.047) and Cohen's kappa was 0.15 (95%CI 0.078-0.23), suggesting poor agreement. DISCUSSION: Most households couldn't reach government secondary care within recognised thresholds indicating poor temporal access. Since GIS-estimated travel time was shorter than community-reported travel time, the true proportion may be lower still. GIS derived estimates of population emergency care access in similar contexts should be interpreted accordingly.",2022,,Injury,53,5,1690-1698,35153068,10.1016/j.injury.2022.02.010,13408,#9124,Whitaker 2022,"",Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care
Cleft lip and palate surgery carried out by one team in Uganda: where have all the palates gone?,"Wilson, J.; Hodges, A.","OBJECTIVE: To determine the distribution of clefts in our operated population in comparison with data in the world literature. DESIGN: A retrospective review of hospital-based cleft procedures undertaken in Uganda over a 10-year period by one surgical team. PATIENTS: 1304 newly presenting cleft patients were identified and analyzed by sex, laterality, and type of cleft, and data were compared with the literature. RESULTS: We found male predominance in cleft lip (CL) and/or palate patients and female predominance in isolated cleft palate (CP) patients. Left-sided CLs presented more frequently than right-sided, bilateral, and midline cleft lips at a ratio of 50∶38∶11∶1. Patients presented most commonly with an isolated CL, followed by cleft lip and palate (CLP), with a small number presenting with isolated CP (966, 306, and 32, respectively). CONCLUSION: The distribution of sex and laterality broadly correlates with findings of other studies; however, a large discrepancy in the proportions of CL, CLP, and CP is apparent. Much higher numbers of CLs and much lower numbers of CLP and CP presented than would be expected in comparison with worldwide literature (2% of patients had an isolated CP). It is hypothesized that the low numbers of patients presenting with combined CLP and CP are due to high mortality among this cohort. If this hypothesis is correct, then in this series of 1304 cleft patients, as many as 3526 CP patients (91% of all CPs) are missing and probably died before undergoing surgical correction.",2012,,Cleft Palate Craniofac J,49,3,299-304,21563901,10.1597/09-039,14159,#9179,Wilson 2012,"",Burden; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations
Prevalence of surgical conditions in individuals aged more than 50 years: a cluster-based household survey in Sierra Leone,"Wong, E. G.; Kamara, T. B.; Groen, R. S.; Zogg, C. K.; Zenilman, M. E.; Kushner, A. L.","BACKGROUND: With the demographic transition disproportionately affecting developing nations, the healthcare burden associated with the elderly is likely to be compounded by poor baseline surgical capacity in these settings. We sought to assess the prevalence of surgical disease and disability in the elderly population of Sierra Leone to guide future development strategies. METHODS: A cluster randomized, cross-sectional household survey was carried out countrywide in Sierra Leone from January 9th to February 3rd 2012. Using a standardized questionnaire, household member demographics, deaths occurring during the previous 12 months, and presence of any current surgical condition were elucidated. A retrospective analysis of individuals aged 50 and over was performed. RESULTS: The survey included 1,843 households with a total of 3,645 respondents. Of these, 13.6 % (496/3,645) were aged over 50 years. Of the elderly individuals in our sample, 301 (60.7 %) reported a current surgical condition. Of current surgical disease identified among elderly individuals (n = 530), 349 (65.8 %) described it as disabling, and 223 (42.1 %) sought help from traditional medicine practitioners. Women (odds ratio [OR] 0.60; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.90) and individuals living in urban settings (OR 0.44, 95 % CI 0.26-0.75) were less likely to report a current surgical problem. Of the 230 elderly deaths in the previous year, 83 (36.1 %) reported a surgical condition in the week prior.

Burden of surgically correctable disabilities among children in the Dadaab Refugee Camp,"Wu, V. K.; Poenaru, D.","BACKGROUND: Surgery is increasingly recognized as a means to reduce the morbidity and mortality of disabling impairments in resource-limited environments. We sought to estimate the burden of surgically correctable disabling impairments and the cost-effectiveness of their treatment among children in a large refugee camp. METHODS: This is a chart review of all patients aged 0-18 years from Dadaab Refugee Camp (Kenya) treated at a facility primarily responsible for providing pediatric surgical care in the region. Total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted were calculated using life expectancy tables and established or estimated disability weights. A sensitivity analysis was performed using various life expectancy tables. Delayed averted DALYs caused by delay in care were also estimated. Inpatient costs were collected to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Between 2005 and 2011 a total of 640 procedures were performed on 341 patients. The median age at surgery was 4.6 years, and 33 % of the children treated were female. Only 13.5 % of surgeries estimated as required for common congenital surgical conditions were actually performed. The total number of DALYs averted ranged from 4,136 to 9,529 (6.4-14.8 per patient), depending on the calculation method used. Cost-effectiveness analysis resulted in values of $40-$88 per DALY.

Burden of surgical congenital anomalies in Kenya: a population-based study,"Wu, V. K.; Poenaru, D.; Poley, M. J.","BACKGROUND: Congenital malformations are a significant component of the global burden of disease among children, accounting for 25 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. Unfortunately, efforts to estimate the burden of pediatric surgical disease in Africa are limited by the absence of population-based data. The objective of this study was to estimate both the prevalence and the disease burden of several common congenital surgical malformations among children in Kenya. METHODS: Community volunteers randomly surveyed households at sites across Kenya. Caretakers were asked to identify on a photographic portfolio, several congenital malformations present among the children in their household, including club foot, hypospadias, hydrocephalus, spina bifida/encephalocele, cleft lip, bladder exstrophy and imperforate anus. DALYs were then calculated based on life expectancy tables and published and estimated disability weights for the conditions encountered. RESULTS: The caregivers of 5559 children (54% female) were surveyed in 1909 households, 56% of which were rural, 31% suburban and 12% urban. The overall prevalence of congenital malformations was 6.3 per 1000 children, amounting to 54-120 DALYs per 1000 children, depending on the life tables used. The most prevalent condition in the survey was club foot, whereas spina bifida had the highest burden of disease.

METHODS: A simulation model using a decision tree template was developed to project the cost and disability-adjusted life-years saved by a pediatric OR in a low-income setting. Parameters are informed by patient outcomes of the surgical procedures performed. Costs of the OR equipment and a literature review were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a pediatric OR. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analysis were performed to assess parameter uncertainty. Economic monetary benefit was calculated using the value of a statistical life approach. RESULTS: A pediatric OR averted a total of 6,447 disability-adjusted life-years /year (95% uncertainty interval 6,288-6,606) and cost $41,182/year (UI 40,539-41,825) in terms of OR installation. The pediatric operating room had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $6.39 per disability-adjusted life-year averted (95% uncertainty interval of 6.19-6.59), or $397.95 (95% uncertainty interval of 385.41-410.67) per life saved based on the country's average life expectancy in 2015. These values were well within the WHO guidelines of cost-effectiveness threshold. The net economic benefit amounted to $5,336,920 for a year of operation, or $16,371 per patient.

METHODS : A retrospective, descriptive study of 176 injured cases that met the terrorist attacks was conducted. The medical data were collected by an electronic database system. All collected data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet for calculation. RESULTS: We found that improvised explosive devices (114/176, 65%) were the most commonly used weapons of attack in Mali. 68.75% of the injuries (121/176) were classified as 'minor injuries according to Abbreviated Injury Scale score. As one patient may suffer multiple injuries, each location and nature of injuries was counted separately. Surface injuries were the top (116/197, 58.88%), followed by orthopaedic injuries (52/197, 26.39%) and internal injuries (29/197, 14.72%). The extremities were the most frequently injured body parts (144/197, 73.09%). We operated 175 surgeries to deal with the 176 combat-related injuries, which accounted for 40.05% of all 437 surgeries. The surgical debridement to remove fragments of explosive was the most frequently performed surgery. We also admitted 20 cases (18/176, 34%) into intensive care unit and transferred 40 cases to Level 3 medical facility. CONCLUSION : Peacekeepers taking protective measures for head and trunk frequently got surface injuries. And their unprotected extremities often got injured.

Delayed access to care and unmet burden of pediatric surgical disease in resource-constrained African countries,"Yousef, Y.; Lee, A.; Ayele, F.; Poenaru, D.","BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to estimate the unmet burden of surgically correctable congenital anomalies in African low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). METHODS: We conducted a chart review of children operated for cryptorchidism, isolated cleft lip, hypospadias, bladder exstrophy and anorectal malformation at an Ethiopian referral hospital between January 2012 and July 2016 and a scoping review of the literature describing the management of congenital anomalies in African LMICs. Procedure numbers and age at surgery were collected to estimate mean surgical delays by country and extrapolate surgical backlog. The unmet surgical need was derived from incidence-based disease estimates, established disability weights, and actual surgical volumes. RESULTS: The chart review yielded 210 procedures in 207 patients from Ethiopia. The scoping review generated 42 data sets, extracted from 36 publications, encompassing: Benin, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Madagascar, Malawi, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The largest national surgical backlog was noted in Nigeria for cryptorchidism (209,260 cases) and cleft lip (4154 cases), and Ethiopia for hypospadias (20,188 cases), bladder exstrophy (575 cases) and anorectal malformation (1349 cases).

The objective was to describe the challenges of surgical management of skin cancer in albinos. Methods: Retrospective, descriptive, and multicenter study on skin cancer surgery in albinos performed over the past 14 years in Ouagadougou. We were interested in surgery indications, techniques, and results. Survival was assessed using the Kaplan–Meier method. Comparisons of proportions were made by Student’s t-test. Results: The cancers were multiple synchronous in 41.3%. We identified 46 albinos with 71 skin cancers. Surgery was performed in 93%. Lesions were located on the back, upper limbs, and head and face in 40.9%, 30.3%, and 16.7%, respectively. Precancerous lesions were treated concomitantly in 23.6%. The surgery consisted of a lumpectomy. Direct suturing and mobilization of flaps allowed skin coverage in 17.9% and 34.3%, respectively. Lymph node dissection was associated with the limbs in 73.1% of localizations. The average number of lymph nodes removed was 11, with extremes of 7 and 14. Node invasion was noted in 16 out of 19 cases. The resection margins were invaded in 7.5% and required surgical revision. Recurrences were noted in 8.9% of cases. Overall 2-year survival rate was 55.8%. Conclusions: Surgery must meet the triple challenge of treating single or multiple synchronous cancers, precancerous lesions, and allowing good healing.

Our aim is to describe the indications, techniques and results of surgery. Methods: A retrospective, multicenter, descriptive study conducted in four West African surgical oncology units. It covers dermatofibrosarcoma surgery performed between January 1, 1988 and December 31, 2020. We took into account the surgical procedure, the mode of skin coverage, adjuvant treatments and survival. Comparisons were possible using Student's t-test and Pearson's χ2. Results: We recorded 81 cases of dermatofibrosarcoma. Surgery was effective in 90.1% of cases. Wide resection was the principle with a mean resection margin of 3.8 ± 1.9 cm. healing by primary intention, flaps and healing by secondary intention were the methods of skin coverage in 30.1%, 24.7% and 41.1% respectively. The type of skin coverage was related to the topography and size of the tumor (p < 0.0001). The healing time is associated with the type of skin cover. The recurrence rate was not related to the type of skin coverage (p = 0.8). Conclusions: Wide and deep resection in the absence of Mohs micrographic surgery ensures healthy margins.

Skin oncoplasties: O-to-Z technique a technique of choice in situation of limited resources? Case of Burkina Faso,"Zongo, N.; Ouedraogo, N. L. M.; Windsouri, M.; Yameogo, L. S. C.; Chabi, T. R. K.; Niamba, P.; Traore, A.","Background In developing countries, the long delays in consultation lead to a delay in diagnosis and management of the skin tumors. The lesions are often large and bring the problem of skin coverage after their resections. Several reconstruction techniques allow skin coverage. The objective of this study is to describe the place of O-to-Z technique in the surgical treatment of skin cancers in Ouagadougou. We hypothesized that O-to-Z technique reduces healing times and the number of dressings compared with directed wound healing. Patients and methods It was a two-center, retrospective, descriptive study on O-to-Z technique in skin cancers. It included patients who underwent surgery between January 1st, 2013 and March 30th, 2021 in Ouagadougou. Scar quality and healing time in Z-plasty were compared with those of secondary healing. We used the Student's t test. Results In 8 years and 3 months, 171 skin cancers were identified. The mean time to consultation was 13.6 months. The average size of the tumors was 9 cm. An O-to-Z technique was performed in 42 cases, being 58.3% of the patients operated on. The average healing time was 15 days. It was four and a half times shorter in O-to-Z technique than in secondary healing. Ischemic necrosis of the Z-corner was noted in 7 cases. The recurrence rate in O-to-Z technique and secondary healing was 7.1% and 9.1% respectively. Hypertrophic or keloidal scars were noticed in 7 cases and hypochromia in 2 cases.

Objective: The objective of the study was to determine the state distribution of new patients presenting with cleft lip and palate, to The UCH. Method: A retrospective review of all new cleft patients presenting to The UCH between January 2012 and June 2015. The data obtained were their local government area of residence, age of the patients, gender of the patients and the type of cleft. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the distribution of patients seen while Chi square test was used to analyze the influence of gender and laterality on the type of cleft. Results: Sixty-seven eligible patients were seen within the study period. Majority (83.6%) of patients seen were from 14 of the 33 Local Government Areas (LGA’s) in Oyo state. Patients were seen from LGA’s in proximity to UCH. A few (16.4%) of the patients came from outside the state. Iwajowa, the LGA with the least number of patients (1.8%) was furthest from UCH. Left sided clefts were significantly more than bilateral or right-sided clefts (p=0.001). Most of the patients from Oluyole LGA had CP while no patient with CP was seen from Lagelu and Akinyele LGA’s. Conclusion: There is the need to intensify cleft awareness programs.

MANAGEMENT OF CONTRACTURES: A FIVE-YEAR EXPERIENCE AT KOMFO ANOKYE TEACHING HOSPITAL IN KUMASI,"Adu, E. J. K.","Background: Contractures are common complications of wounds healing by secondary intention; some cases are idiopathic and a few are congenital. Contractures cause significant morbidity to patients. Objective: The study was undertaken to document the pattern, spectrum and management of patients with contractures of various types and aetiologies presenting at a Plastic and Reconstructive Surgical Unit in Ghana. Design: Prospective study from January 2004 to December 2008. Setting: Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi Patients and Methods: The age, sex, site, extent and cause of contracture was documented. The patients were examined and functional impairment recorded. A clinical photograph was taken. Patients requiring surgery had their contractures released and the defect repaired with an appropriate reconstructive technique. Patients with minimal functional impairment underwent physical therapy without surgery. Results: Sixty-eight patients comprising 44 males and 24 females were seen. Male to female ratio is 1.83:1. Their ages ranged from 0.66 to 60 years, mean age was 22.53 years. Seventy-six contractures were studied. Fifty-eight of the lesions were in the upper part of the body. Burns, infections and trauma were the main aetiological causes. Seventy-one surgical procedures were performed including release and flap repair (33), full thickness skin graft (23) and partial thickness skins graft and splinting (six). Conclusions: Thermal burns and soft tissue infections are the commonest causes of contractures presenting at KATH in Kumasi.

Surgical Reconstruction of Northern Uganda War Victims,"E.W. Kalanzi, R. Ssentongo R. Alenyo R. Zeeman","Background: Aid groups estimate that since 1086 when the war conflicts in Northern Uganda started, over 30,000 people have died in the insurgency and over 20,000 people have remained maimed. Arising from the conflict, innocent civilians have had their limbs, lips, eyes, ears, noses, breasts, fingers and toes cut off. Patients and Methods: Between 2004 and 2005, a total of 34 victims of the Northern Uganda war, underwent reconstructive surgery. Most of the patients were treated from the local hospitals of Lira, Gulu and Kitgum. Results: Between 2004 and 2006, the Plastic Surgery team of Mulago hospital rehabilitated 34 victims of the northern war. Of these 23 were females and 11 were males. Most of these people had suffered severe disfigurements which necessitated multiple staged reconstructive procedures on them. The majority of the reconstructive operations were on the lips despite the fact that many victims had also suffered from mutilation of other body parts. Conclusion: Effects of the insurgency on individuals, families and communities included: Increased burden on health care delivery Hospital capacity overwhelmed with few doctors and nurses available Increased number of traumatised people Increased number of war causalities Population maimed with body parts cut off Increased dependency of local population on hand outs from government and relief agencies.

Our objective was to evaluate the practice of the team approach concept and practices of the specialists involved in oro‑facial cleft care in Africa. Materials and Methods: A snapshot survey was conducted among the attendees of the 2nd Pan‑African Congress on Cleft Lip and Palate, at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria, in February 2007. Result: Of the 120 questionnaires distributed, 91 were returned for analysis (75.8% response rate). Mean age of respondents was 43.6 ± 4.97 years and the range was 36‑62 years. Male‑to‑female ratio was 3.5:1. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and Plastic Surgeons constituted the majority of respondents (34.1% and 29.7% respectively). Only 48.4% (44 respondents) of the specialists belonged to cleft teams. Majority of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and Plastic Surgeons belonged to cleft teams (65.9 and 79.5% respectively), while Speech Pathologists and Orthodontists were less represented (18.2% and 40.9% respectively). Conclusion: Findings from this study have shown that interdisciplinary care for the cleft patient is not yet fully established in Africa.

"Morbidity and mortality of paediatric burns patients at Maputo Central Hospital, Mozambique","Amado, Vanda; Da Rocha, Massada; Khosa, Dalva; Langa, Stella; DeUgarte, Daniel A.; Yohannan, Prem","Background: The incidence of paediatric burn injuries is increasing in Africa. Paediatric burn injuries are among the leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Research on the morbidity and mortality in this setting is much needed. Methods: We conducted a prospective questionnaire-based analysis of paediatric burn patients presenting to the Maputo Central Hospital during a five-month period. Interviews were conducted with the children's caretakers by 2 paediatric surgery residents and 1 paediatrician at the Eduardo Mondlane Medical School in Maputo, with the aid of nursing staff. Results: Questionnaires were completed for 66 patients. Most burns occurred from scald injuries (n = 46), particularly from cooking (n = 27) and bathwater (n = 19), followed by fire injuries (n = 16). Burns occurred more frequently in the afternoon (n = 26) and morning (n = 23). Many patients reported no adult caretaker present at the time of the burn injury (n = 24). Most burns were grade II (n = 49). Nearly half of the patients received a blood transfusion (n = 30). One-third of the patients underwent operative surgical debridement (n = 21). Skin grafting was performed on a subset of these patients (n = 13). A large number of patients developed a wound infection (n = 39). All deaths occurred in patients who were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit and had sepsis (n = 9). The mean total body surface area (TBSA) of burn deaths was 37% (range 20% to 50%), and many deaths were secondary to fire burns (6 of 9; 66.7%). Conclusions: Most paediatric burn injuries occur in association with domestic activities, such as cooking and bathing. Adult caretakers are frequently not present at the time of the burn injury. Mortality rates are high, especially for large body surface area burns caused by fire. Educational programmes may help reduce the incidence of burns and the associated morbidity and mortality. The improvement and expansion of emergency and intensive burn care services may help to improve survival.",2017,,East and Central African Journal of Surgery,22,3,7,,,11525,#9549,Amado 2017,"",Burns; DALYs

Funding paediatric surgery procedures in sub-Saharan Africa,"Ekenze, Sebastian O.; Jac-Okereke, Chukwunonso A.; Nwankwo, Elochukwu P.","screening, full-text review and data abstraction were completed and resulting data were analysed using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software. Results Thirty-five studies met our inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The countries that were predominantly emphasized in the publications reviewed were Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana and Uganda. The paediatric surgical procedures involved general paediatric surgery/ urology, cardiac surgery, neurosurgery, oncology, plastics, ophthalmology, orthopaedics and otorhinolaryngology. The mean cost of these procedures ranged from 60 to 21,140 United States Dollars (USD). The source of funding for these procedures was mostly out-of-pocket payments (OOPs) by the patient’s family in 32 studies, (91.4%) and medical mission/non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in 21 (60%) studies. This pattern did not differ appreciably between the articles published in the initial and latter 5 years of the study period, although there was a trend towards a reduction in OOP funding. Improvements in healthcare funding by individual countries supported by international organizations and charities were the predominant suggested solutions to challenges in funding. Conclusion While considering the potential limitations created by diversity in study design, the reviewed publications indicate that funding for paediatric surgical procedures in sub-Saharan Africa is mostly by OOPs made by families of the patients. This may result in limited access to some procedures. Coordinated efforts, and collaboration between individual countries and international agencies, may help to reduce OOP funding and thus improve access to critical procedures.",2019,,Malawi Medical Journal,31,3,7,,,11526,#9552,Ekenze 2019,Saidu Ahmad Idris (2025-02-04 18:52:45)(Select): Barriers to care; ,""
"Free Flap Surgery at Mengo Hospital, Uganda -A Review of The First 19 Consecutive Microvascular Free Tissue Transfers","Galiwango, G.

Challenges Facing Surgical Training in the Great Lakes Region in Sub-Saharan Africa: a Review Article,"Galukande, M.; Luboga, S.; Elobu, E.","Background: There is a severe shortage of health workers in sub-Saharan Africa yet this subcontinent experiences a significant proportion of the world’s disease burden. This shortage is further reflected in the lack of personnel for surgical sub specialities such as orthopaedics, paediatrics, neurology and urology to mention but a few. Objective: This review therefore sought to summarize the current literature on the state of surgical training in sub Saharan Africa, discuss the challenges faced and the possible ways to overcome these challenges Methods: We performed online searches of electronic databases i.e. PUBMED, MEDLINE and African Journals online that feature many African Journals not index by the ‘regular’ databases. Results: The searches returned 88 articles and 24 of which were included in the review, we present results focused on; training capacity and methods, scope of practice, technology and surgery, and low research capacity and output. Conclusion: The future of surgical training in Africa will depend on the ability of the leadership to create or and adopt innovative educational technologies, recruit and retain trainers and attract trainees on one hand and on the other, the growth of demand for quality surgical care in the great lakes regions. For those that have excelled in training need to build on those successes and share their stories.",2013,,East and Central African Journal of Surgery,18,3,9,,,11528,#9554,Galukande 2013,"",Barriers to Care; Surgical Capacity

Barriers to timely surgery and early surgical outcomes for breast cancer patients in a setting with limited resources,"Ntirenganya, F.; Hirwa, A.; Banguti, P.; Ainhoa, C. C.; Rulisa, S.","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients in Rwanda are young, premenopausal and presenting with advanced stages. Surgery is often the primary line of treatment and its timing may impact adjuvant medical and/or radiation therapies, influencing negative outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify barriers to timely surgery and describe early surgical outcomes for patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer at two tertiary hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali and Rwanda Military Hospital over 12 a month period from May 2016 to May 2017. RESULTS: 69 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 48 years. 74.16% of patients ≤ 60 years, 58% were premenopausal. 69.5% presented with locally advanced stages. Mean duration of symptoms was 10.9 months before initial consultation. Patients had to wait 91 days (3 months) before surgery. Mean hospital stay was 5 days after surgery and 98.9% underwent modified radical mastectomy. No major complications reported. Socio-economic status(p=0.0002), level of education (p=0.000), traditional healer’s consultation (p=0.0001) influenced the timing of the initial consultation. Level of first heath facility consulted (P=0.00045), number of breast surgeon (p=0.0000), pathology report availability, (p=0.0004) and imaging availability (p=:0.0006) influenced timing of surgery. CONCLUSION: Delays to surgery are both patient and system-related. Increased awareness, surgical outreaches and task sharing with a non-breast surgical specialist may decrease delays to surgery and increase timely access to subsequent adjuvant therapies. Even if early surgical outcomes are good, long term follow up study is necessary to assess oncological outcomes.",2019,,Rwanda Medical Journal,76,4,5,,,11532,#9563,Ntirenganya 2019,Rachel Wangi (2025-01-31 01:50:39)(Select): Barriers to care; ,""
Keloids: Assessment of effects and psychosocial- impacts on subjects in a black African population,"Olaitan, P. B.","Background: Keloids are vexatious swelling on the skin or the conjuctiva. The effects and impacts of these lesions have not been assessed in a keloid endemic environment like Nigeria. Aims: The purpose of this study is to assess the psychosocial impact as well as effects of keloids on the subjects in a black African population where lesions are commonly seen. Methods: This is a prospective study which assesses the impacts of keloid on keloid patients. Consented patients who presented to the Plastic Surgery Clinic of the Lautech Teaching Hospital, Osogbo, Nigeria were recruited into the study. A set of questionnaires were administered to all consented patients. The administered questionnaires were analyzed using SPSS version 10. Results: One hundred and thirty one patients were involved in this study. They comprised of 61 males and 70 females. Most (96.8%) of them had the keloid lesion for more than one year. Sixteen (12.2%) of the patients felt that keloids negatively affect their works, 64 (48.9%) of the patients felt stigmatized by keloids, 28 (56.0%) of them who had lesions in conspicuous parts while 24 (46.2%) had lesions in non-conspicuous parts. Females (59.1%) felt stigmatized than males. Only 47 (35.8%) of the patients believed that keloid swelling limit their social interaction.

Surgical Volumes at the District Hospital: A Retrospective Review of National Data in Rwanda,"Petroze, R. T.; Nzayisenga, A.; Calland, J. F.; Ntakiyiruta, G.","Background: Surgical conditions are a significant contributor to global morbidity and mortality, and much of the burden of surgical disease arises in resource-limited settings. There are profound disparities in surgical care worldwide, with only 3.5% of surgical procedures estimated to be performed in the poorest 1/3 of countries. Yet, very little is known regarding the true volume of surgical procedures performed in resource-limited settings. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of aggregate district hospital statistics provided to the Ministry of Health in Rwanda from 40 district hospitals over the period from January 2008-September 2010. Results: The total numbers of major procedures performed at the District Hospital level in Rwanda were 23,621 for 2008, 43,389 for 2009, and 32,944 for the first nine months of 2010. Obstetrics and gynecology procedures comprised 75.5%, 60.8%, and 61.4% of major operations in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Of those, caesarian sections were 87.3% (2008), 87.7% (2009) and 89.1% (2010). Hernia repairs were the most common general surgery procedure. Reported post-operative infection rates were 0.8%, 0.4% and 0.2% for 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively. Conclusions: Comparable to the global literature, the majority of procedures performed at the District Hospital level in Rwanda are caesarian sections.

Untreated surgical conditions in Malawi: A randomised cross-sectional nationwide household survey,"Varela, Carlos; Young, Sven; Groen, Reinou; Banza, Leonard; Mkandawire, Nyengo C.; Viste, Asgaut","Background Noncommunicable diseases, such as surgical conditions have received little attention from public health planners in low income countries (LIC) like Malawi. Though increasingly recognised as a growing global health problem, the burden of surgical pathologies and access to surgical care has not been adequately identified in many LIC. Information on the spectrum and burden of surgical disease in Malawi is important to uncover the unmet need for surgery and for planning of the National Health Service. Methods This was a multistage random cluster sampling national survey. Households were selected from clusters using probability proportional to size method. 1448 households and 2909 interviewees were analysed. The Surgeons Overseas Assessment of Surgical need (SOSAS) tool was used to collect data. This electronic tablet based questionnaire tool included general information and a dual personalised head to toe inquiry on surgical conditions. The general information included number of household members, and inquired on any death within the past twelve months, and if any of the deaths in the family had a suspected surgical condition leading to that death. Data was collected by specially trained third year medical students. Results Out of 1480 selected households, 1448 (98%) agreed to participate, with 2909 interviewed individuals included in the study. The median household size was 6 individuals (range 1 - 47). Median age of interviewed persons was 35 years (range 0.25 - 104 years). 1027 out of 2909 (35%) of the interviewed people reported to be living with a condition requiring surgical consultation or intervention, whereas 146 of 616 (24%) of the total deaths reported to have occurred in the preceding 12 months were reported to have died from a surgically related condition. Most individuals did not seek health care due to lack of funds for transportation to the health facility. Only 3.1% of those that reported a surgical condition had surgical intervention. Conclusions There is a large unmet need for surgical care in Malawi. A third of the population is living with a condition needing surgical consultation or intervention, and a quarter of all deaths are potentially avoidable with surgery. Urgent scale up of surgical services and training are needed to reduce this huge gap in public health planning in the country.",2017,,Malawi Medical Journal,29,3,231-236,,10.4314/mmj.v29i3.1,11519,#9571,Varela 2017,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-31 01:48:37)(Select): .
