will definitely contribute to a better outcome for some of these neonates. Improved techniques for keeping babies
warm abound in our culture. It may be worthwhile to advocate their use""",NA,NA,NA

""We note that accessibility to hospitals stands out as a major factor in delayed access to essential surgical care mainly attributable to economic aspects such as lack of transport. Economic factors as well hindered access to surgeries among those that accessed hospitals on time underscoring the need to prioritize poverty eradication as a major determinant of health. Noteworthy large lists of patients to undergo surgery versus the limited number of surgeons came through as a major factor drawing back to the inadequate specialist workforce.""","Chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, multivariable logistic regression",NA,NA,"635 patients over 2 years
