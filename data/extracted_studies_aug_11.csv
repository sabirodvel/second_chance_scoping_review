Some equipment, such as pulse oximetry and ventilators, were available in limited numbers and thus were not available to all who needed them on an emergency basis.
 Some nonreusable items, such as chest tubes, frequently ran out of stock. The problem was often not cost of repurchase, but difficulties and delays in the procurement process. Arterial blood gas determinations were possible at
some large hospitals. However, the cost of the test kept it from being used frequently. For example, repeat tests on the same patient on the same day
were rare. here were frequent, often long, periods of inoperability
of pieces of equipment while awaiting repairs. Especially problematic were computerized axial tomography
(CT) and image intensification (C arms).
 There were occasional periods of unavailability of laboratory tests when reagents ran out of stock. Sometimes, services (such as CT scanning) were
available but only to those who could pay, often in advance. This limited the availability of such services
on an emergency basis.
 No facility had capabilities for autotransfusion from
chest tubes.
 Prostheses for amputees were absent in almost all
locations. They were sometimes available in capital
cities, at the patient s own expense. The cost and time
for travel to distant locations and the cost of the
prostheses greatly limited their availability.

ma-related medications, especially antibiotics and anal-
gesics. There were frequent shortages, with relatives
needing to buy medications from private pharmacies.

Increase training capacity for certain highly deficient specialties, such as those involved with rehabilitation. Increase the capacity for conducting trauma continuing education.
Increase the utilization of such continuing education courses such as by institutional policies that both require and subsidize these courses for key staff.

Physical resources 
Each country or region should define trauma-related equipment and supplies that are ‘‘essential’’ at different levels of the health care system. Availability of such essential items should be assured through an appropriate monitoring process, which might involve hospital inspection. Availability of such essential items could be promoted by tightening up processes for procurement and timely repair of equipment, as well as by arrangements within facilities to locate essential items where they can be rapidly utilized when needed. Better optimize the planning for both human and physical resources so as to avoid wasteful mismatches. 

Security for health care personnel 
Increase capacity for sharps and biological waste disposal as well as training in universal precautions. Increase capacity for delivery of antiretroviral postexposure prophylaxis. 

Administrative functions 
Strengthen the capacity for trauma organization and planning in both individual facilities and in ministries of health. Establish trauma-related quality improvement programs that identify and address correctable factors in preventable deaths and that are appropriate for local conditions.

Although commendable strides have been made in cleft care in SSA, significant barriers, many of which are coupled to overall surgical care delivery, remain. The strengthening of African initiatives to support African-led comprehensive cleft care will be both imperative and exciting to witness in the coming decades.

""Barriers to comprehensive cleft care in SSA include lack of awareness that treatment exists, geographic barriers to access, financial burdens, scarcity of training opportunities, and the inadequate surgical workforce.""",,,,,,,"Globalization of cleft care:
Efforts to improving CLP care in SSA have historically taken the form of short-term surgical interventions (STSIs), conventionally referred to as ‘mission’ trips. These short, service-based trips emphasize efficiency and surgical volume and arrive with large numbers of international staff. Successful STSIs share the expertise of visiting surgeons, provide educational opportunities for local surgeons, and foster long-term relationships over many years. Learning is bidirectional as visiting surgeons learn different systems of care and witness the surgical challenges of operating within a more resource-limited setting. There is a lack of focus on sustainability and effort to strengthen internal systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Limited surgical infrastructure ,"Surgeries performed by visiting teams rely on long-term postoperative care supported by local health infrastructure. Despite data demonstrating that comprehensive cleft care is best achieved by a multidisciplinary team of counsellors/social workers, speech therapists, dentists, orthodontists, nutritionists, and audiologists, cleft surgeons in SSA cite difficulty in accessing these specialists.",out-of-pocket costs,"The majority of caregivers are from low-income families, yet a majority of payments for pediatric surgery in SSA are made out-of-pocket by the parent or guardian. Limited financial resources lead to delayed repair with speech, aesthetic, surgical, and psychological consequences ",Travel time,"48 SSA countries found that only 29% of the population were located within a 2 h travel time to the nearest public hospital, far below the international recommendation of 80%. No standardization of services provided by these public hospitals",Awareness,"Lack of awareness where CLP may be viewed as spiritual retribution with shifting of blame onto the mother, leading to a sense of shame that further hinders the seeking of timely care. Traditional healers often predominate as the first line source of medical care, particularly in rural regions, and may be less likely to refer a child with CLP to a surgeon.

",Literacy,"Patient literacy rates vary widely within SSA, with half of caregivers in Nigeria having a secondary education.",,,,,,,"Awareness:
Cleft education should target both prospective parents as well as physicians, nurses, and community health workers. Initiatives should focus on capturing those caregivers with the highest potential for early CLP identification and referral, including hospital staff in maternity wards, midwives, community health workers, and specifically in SSA, traditional healers. Additionally, the rise of mobile phones and the expansion of internet access bring promise for more efficient information delivery, democratization of health education, and ultimately lower the barrier to surgical care. 

Financial barriers:
The focus should be shifted internally with the expansion of national health insurance to cover more aspects of comprehensive cleft care.

Geographic barriers:
Although the ultimate solution to reducing geographic barriers is a more robust rural health infrastructure, existing health resources can be maximized in the meantime through decentralization. Task sharing, whereby tasks are shared between different health workers. This endeavor can be further enhanced through telesurgery, whereby less experienced surgical teams can take on surgeries under the virtual supervision of specialists. Another example of decentralization is through active case-finding targeted toward remote regions.

Cleft Surgical Workforce:
Increasing local training opportunities and by improving the quality of existing training programs. International cleft NGOs (e.g. Operation Smile, Smile Train) fund training sessions for surgeons and other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team, relying on local or regional trainers. Lastly, there is an emerging role for technology in interdisciplinary, international cleft discussion forums and education. 

Fragmentation of Cleft Care:
Short-term surgical interventions should at a minimum include one cleft surgeon, anesthesia provider, and nurse from the country where the intervention is taking place. STSIs should consciously shift from an emphasis on surgical volume to that of skills transfer, with emphasis on integrating other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team who can provide training and education. Furthermore, initiatives geared towards raising community awareness of CLP should highlight the importance of long-term follow-up and multidisciplinary care in addition to timely surgical repair.",,,

""A comparison of patients age at time of consultation with congenital anomalies in this study and elsewhere suggests that the delayed ages of presentation at HEAL Africa Hospital are
among the highest worldwide. This may be explained by the DRC’s poor health system, lack of awareness initiatives, the lack of a plastic surgery center in the country, the absence of roads, etc. To our knowledge, there are two plastic surgeons in the whole of the DRC (around 74 million people). Delayed consultation combined with lack of specialized
care is a major health challenge faced in DRC"";

""Anorectal malformations were reported to be very common in other African countries like
Uganda and Nigeria. This is not the case in our setting. This difference in diagnosis/presentation is likely due to the inability to access care in time to correct the defect in DRC, thus many die before reaching the health facility.  Those born in the remote jungle without access to surgeons and radiologists, as well as not having money available to cover fees, often stay home untreated until death""",Insurance related barriers,"""Due to the immense poverty in the area, the majority of patients (79.1%) relied on mercy funds to pay for treatment""",Physical distance; Transportation issues,"""Though more individuals are being treated by HEAL, we found that distance is still the most significant n predictor of delayed correction""

""There is a clear need for the construction of additional regional surgery centers in an effort to provide localized care for patients in rural DRC, directly combatting the most significant barrier to care. Furthermore, to ensure earlier treatment in rural areas, we recommend continued large scale community education/sensitization campaigns informing the public about the treatment options available, early consultation, availability of money to cover care/travel, and success rate of corrective procedures. Over time we hope that we can educate individuals that congenital abnormalities are not a divine curse and encourage corrective treatment rather than other, often more morbid alternatives""",,,
