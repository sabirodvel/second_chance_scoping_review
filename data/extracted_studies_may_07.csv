""A Monte Carlo simulation over 200, facility based iterations was performed on the pediatric OR model. Accounting for an annual inflation rate of 5.5%, mean annualized cost of the OR construction and maintenance was $41,182 per year of operation (95% uncertainty interval(UI) of 40,539–41,825). Mean simulation DALYs accumulated with no time discounting or age weighting were 10,421 per year (95% UI 10,168–10,674) for the counterfactual and 3,974 per year (95% UI 3,873–4,074) for the pediatric OR intervention. When a 3% time discount was included, the counterfactual DALYs accumulated is adjusted to 4,844 DALYs per year (95% UI 4,723 – 4,965), and the OR intervention accumulated 1,834 DALYs per year (95% UI 1,787–1,881). The incremental disease burden averted by the OR was 6,447 DALYs averted (95% UI 6,288–6,606), or 2,989 DALYs averted (95% UI 2,903–3,075) with time-discounting. The mean simulation ICER was $6.39 per DALY averted (95% UI 6.19–6.59), which amounts to $397.95 (95% UI 385.41–410.67) per life saved based on average life expectancy in Uganda in 2015 (62.3 years). With a 3% time-discount, the ICER increased to $13.63 per DALY averted (95% UI $13.24–14.26) or $852.43 per life saved (95% UI 824.67–888.40). Regardless of time discounting, the ICER of the OR intervention and cost per life saved are well below the cost-effectiveness threshold of 1 and 3 times the GDP per capita of Uganda in 2015 ($2026.71).

Cleft education should target both prospective parents as well as physicians, nurses, and community health workers.

Additionally, the rise of mobile phones and the expansion of internet access bring promise for more efficient information delivery, democratization of health education, and ultimately lower the barrier to surgical care. 

Financial barriers:
The focus should be shifted internally with the expansion of national health insurance to cover more aspects of comprehensive cleft care.

Geographic barriers:
Although the ultimate solution to reducing geographic barriers is a more robust rural health infrastructure, existing health resources can be maximized in the meantime through decentralization. Task sharing, whereby tasks are shared between different health workers. This endeavor can be further enhanced through telesurgery, whereby less experienced surgical teams can take on surgeries under the virtual supervision of specialists. Another example of decentralization is through active case-finding targeted toward remote regions.

Cleft Surgical Workforce:
Increasing local training opportunities and by improving the quality of existing training programs. International cleft NGOs (e.g. Operation Smile, Smile Train) fund training sessions for surgeons and other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team, relying on local or regional trainers. Lastly, there is an emerging role for technology in interdisciplinary, international cleft discussion forums and education. 

Fragmentation of Cleft Care:
Short-term surgical interventions should at a minimum include one cleft surgeon, anesthesia provider, and nurse from the country where the intervention is taking place. STSIs should consciously shift from an emphasis on surgical volume to that of skills transfer, with emphasis on integrating other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team who can provide training and education.

Objective 2 
•	Between 1993 and 2008, 5,740 operations were performed, and complete data were available for 5,735 (99.9%) patients. There were 5,774 surgical diagnoses, which were categorized as either acquired or congenital
•	There were 3,885 (67.3%) acquired conditions and 1,889 (32.7%) congenital conditions
•	Of the acquired conditions, there were 1,985 (34.4%) burns, either acute or sequelae such as contracture or open wounds, 514 (8.9%) keloids, 448 (7.8%) other injuries, 410 (7.1%) deep tissue infections, including osteomyelitis and cancrum oris (noma), and 343 (5.9%) tumors
•	Among the 1,889 congenital anomalies, 1,259 (21.8%) were cleft lip or cleft palate, and 354 (6.1%) were limb defects
•	Pediatric cases make up the majority of cases that presented for plastic surgery for both acquired conditions, notably burns, and congenital conditions
Objective 3 
•	Zambia has one plastic surgeon for the population of 12.6 million and no formal training program in plastic surgery.
•	There is a severe shortage of trained surgical clinicians, with an average of three surgeons produced each year. Specialty surgical care such as orthopedics, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and urology is markedly limited, and patients must travel to the capital of Lusaka for most specialty consultations and procedures.
•	The population of 12.6 million is low density with 64% living in rural areas, which makes development of facilities and infrastructure expensive on a per capita basis. Road infrastructure is poor, and Zambians have few options for transport over long distances.
•	Most  patients with burns and trauma presented after the acute phase with contractures and chronic wounds, pointing to missed opportunities to prevent disability and complications with proper acute and subacute care.
•	Delivery of plastic surgery to patients in rural areas is achieved through a mobile service supported by nongovernmental organization (NGO) funding and in cooperation with more than 30 district and mission hospitals who organize patients for two to three annual visits.

•	50% of burn wound patients reached a healthcare facility within 24 hours.
•	74% of patients referred from another facility arrived at the regional hospital within 3 weeks.
•	Barriers to timely access included lack of trust, lack of money, and reliance on traditional healers (consulted by 33% of burn wound patients first).
SURGICAL CAPACITY 
•	53% of burn wound patients initially sought care at another facility, where 95% received only conservative treatment (fluids, pain medication, antibiotics, and dressings), and only 1 patient (5%) received surgical debridement.
•	Among contracture patients, 70% never received surgical care or a referral, despite clear indications for skin grafting.
•	At the referral hospital, 75% of burn wound patients and 100% of contracture patients required surgery. However, 26% of burn wound patients who needed surgery did not receive it.
AFFORDABILITY
•	Only 25% of burn patients and 26% of contracture patients had their cost covered by health insurance.
•	The mean hospital fee was $378 for burn patients and $167 for contracture patients.
•	Given an average household daily income of $0.73, the cost of care exceeded the catastrophic health expenditure threshold by 6 times for contracture patients and 15 times for burn patients.

infected wounds and in a poor overall condition [10,26]. These
patients are often malnourished, anaemic and are poor candidates
for immediate surgery. Malnourishment is a risk factor for post-
operative mortality. While associated with increased length of
stay, high infection rates and higher costs, delayed debridement
and grafting may still be the best option in this patient group""","","","","","","","it might be necessary to take sufficient time to stabilize patients and prepare them for surgery in low resource settings.
An individual plan for staged excisions for a specific burn injury in a specific setting might be the most appropriate approach in low resource settings where resources and skills meet the minimal standards for basic surgical burn care. Specific body parts, in particular areas like joint surfaces that benefit from early interventions, starting with early excision may be advisable there. The
use of tourniquets and local anaesthesia with adrenaline where possible, renders this approach more suitable. The ISBI guidelines stress the importance of the combination of the dressing method and the timing of excision and grafting in full thickness burns. They recommend (staged) early excision and grafting combined with closed wound treatment when resources permit, except for hands, perineum and the face.","","",""
