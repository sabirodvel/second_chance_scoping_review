Although commendable strides have been made in cleft care in SSA, significant barriers, many of which are coupled to overall surgical care delivery, remain. The strengthening of African initiatives to support African-led comprehensive cleft care will be both imperative and exciting to witness in the coming decades.

""Barriers to comprehensive cleft care in SSA include lack of awareness that treatment exists, geographic barriers to access, financial burdens, scarcity of training opportunities, and the inadequate surgical workforce.""",,,,,,,"Globalization of cleft care:
Efforts to improving CLP care in SSA have historically taken the form of short-term surgical interventions (STSIs), conventionally referred to as ‘mission’ trips. These short, service-based trips emphasize efficiency and surgical volume and arrive with large numbers of international staff. Successful STSIs share the expertise of visiting surgeons, provide educational opportunities for local surgeons, and foster long-term relationships over many years. Learning is bidirectional as visiting surgeons learn different systems of care and witness the surgical challenges of operating within a more resource-limited setting. There is a lack of focus on sustainability and effort to strengthen internal systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Limited surgical infrastructure ,"Surgeries performed by visiting teams rely on long-term postoperative care supported by local health infrastructure. Despite data demonstrating that comprehensive cleft care is best achieved by a multidisciplinary team of counsellors/social workers, speech therapists, dentists, orthodontists, nutritionists, and audiologists, cleft surgeons in SSA cite difficulty in accessing these specialists.",out-of-pocket costs,"The majority of caregivers are from low-income families, yet a majority of payments for pediatric surgery in SSA are made out-of-pocket by the parent or guardian. Limited financial resources lead to delayed repair with speech, aesthetic, surgical, and psychological consequences ",Travel time,"48 SSA countries found that only 29% of the population were located within a 2 h travel time to the nearest public hospital, far below the international recommendation of 80%. No standardization of services provided by these public hospitals",Awareness,"Lack of awareness where CLP may be viewed as spiritual retribution with shifting of blame onto the mother, leading to a sense of shame that further hinders the seeking of timely care. Traditional healers often predominate as the first line source of medical care, particularly in rural regions, and may be less likely to refer a child with CLP to a surgeon.

",Literacy,"Patient literacy rates vary widely within SSA, with half of caregivers in Nigeria having a secondary education.",,,,,,,"Awareness:
Cleft education should target both prospective parents as well as physicians, nurses, and community health workers. Initiatives should focus on capturing those caregivers with the highest potential for early CLP identification and referral, including hospital staff in maternity wards, midwives, community health workers, and specifically in SSA, traditional healers. Additionally, the rise of mobile phones and the expansion of internet access bring promise for more efficient information delivery, democratization of health education, and ultimately lower the barrier to surgical care. 

Financial barriers:
The focus should be shifted internally with the expansion of national health insurance to cover more aspects of comprehensive cleft care.

Geographic barriers:
Although the ultimate solution to reducing geographic barriers is a more robust rural health infrastructure, existing health resources can be maximized in the meantime through decentralization. Task sharing, whereby tasks are shared between different health workers. This endeavor can be further enhanced through telesurgery, whereby less experienced surgical teams can take on surgeries under the virtual supervision of specialists. Another example of decentralization is through active case-finding targeted toward remote regions.

Cleft Surgical Workforce:
Increasing local training opportunities and by improving the quality of existing training programs. International cleft NGOs (e.g. Operation Smile, Smile Train) fund training sessions for surgeons and other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team, relying on local or regional trainers. Lastly, there is an emerging role for technology in interdisciplinary, international cleft discussion forums and education. 

Fragmentation of Cleft Care:
Short-term surgical interventions should at a minimum include one cleft surgeon, anesthesia provider, and nurse from the country where the intervention is taking place. STSIs should consciously shift from an emphasis on surgical volume to that of skills transfer, with emphasis on integrating other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team who can provide training and education. Furthermore, initiatives geared towards raising community awareness of CLP should highlight the importance of long-term follow-up and multidisciplinary care in addition to timely surgical repair.",,,

30 (37.0%) of all respondents indicated that their departments do not offer split thickness skin grafting at all.

Effects of split thickness skin grafting in the institutions of the respondents:
Split-thickness skin grafts were generally considered to help reduce length of hospital stay (LOS) (n = 59, 72.8%), reduce scarring (n = 44, 54.3%) and burden of disease, allowing for a quicker return to daily life (n = 34, 42.0%). Majority also reported that it reduces mortality rates (n = 32, 39.5%), need for corrective surgery (n = 32, 39.5%) and infection rates (n = 27, 33.3%). 
On the contrary, 6 (7.4%) respondents indicated that STSG generally have a high risk of overall negative effects for the patient due to complications.
