Although commendable strides have been made in cleft care in SSA, significant barriers, many of which are coupled to overall surgical care delivery, remain. The strengthening of African initiatives to support African-led comprehensive cleft care will be both imperative and exciting to witness in the coming decades.

""Barriers to comprehensive cleft care in SSA include lack of awareness that treatment exists, geographic barriers to access, financial burdens, scarcity of training opportunities, and the inadequate surgical workforce.""",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Globalization of cleft care:
Efforts to improving CLP care in SSA have historically taken the form of short-term surgical interventions (STSIs), conventionally referred to as ‘mission’ trips. These short, service-based trips emphasize efficiency and surgical volume and arrive with large numbers of international staff. Successful STSIs share the expertise of visiting surgeons, provide educational opportunities for local surgeons, and foster long-term relationships over many years. Learning is bidirectional as visiting surgeons learn different systems of care and witness the surgical challenges of operating within a more resource-limited setting.

Traditional healers often predominate as the first line source of medical care, particularly in rural regions, and may be less likely to refer a child with CLP to a surgeon.

",Literacy,"Patient literacy rates vary widely within SSA, with half of caregivers in Nigeria having a secondary education.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Awareness:
Cleft education should target both prospective parents as well as physicians, nurses, and community health workers. Initiatives should focus on capturing those caregivers with the highest potential for early CLP identification and referral, including hospital staff in maternity wards, midwives, community health workers, and specifically in SSA, traditional healers. Additionally, the rise of mobile phones and the expansion of internet access bring promise for more efficient information delivery, democratization of health education, and ultimately lower the barrier to surgical care. 

Financial barriers:
The focus should be shifted internally with the expansion of national health insurance to cover more aspects of comprehensive cleft care.

Geographic barriers:
Although the ultimate solution to reducing geographic barriers is a more robust rural health infrastructure, existing health resources can be maximized in the meantime through decentralization. Task sharing, whereby tasks are shared between different health workers. This endeavor can be further enhanced through telesurgery, whereby less experienced surgical teams can take on surgeries under the virtual supervision of specialists. Another example of decentralization is through active case-finding targeted toward remote regions.

Cleft Surgical Workforce:
Increasing local training opportunities and by improving the quality of existing training programs. International cleft NGOs (e.g. Operation Smile, Smile Train) fund training sessions for surgeons and other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team, relying on local or regional trainers. Lastly, there is an emerging role for technology in interdisciplinary, international cleft discussion forums and education. 

Fragmentation of Cleft Care:
Short-term surgical interventions should at a minimum include one cleft surgeon, anesthesia provider, and nurse from the country where the intervention is taking place. STSIs should consciously shift from an emphasis on surgical volume to that of skills transfer, with emphasis on integrating other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team who can provide training and education. Furthermore, initiatives geared towards raising community awareness of CLP should highlight the importance of long-term follow-up and multidisciplinary care in addition to timely surgical repair.",NA,NA,NA

""The attitude of the mother who gives birth to a baby
with congenital anomaly, is often reinforced by the
attitude of neighbours and other family members, thus adding to the suffering of the mother. Furthermore, the
babies with gross anomalies sometimes attract unkind comments from even health workers, who should know better, on arrival at the facility""",NA,NA,NA,NA,Surgeon training gaps; continuous medical education,"""Consequently, most anaesthetists do not have this skill because of lack of opportunity and

""With regard to anaesthetic management, the anaesthetist must know the pharmacokinetics of the anaesthetic agents used in the neonates. Neonates are sensitive to non-depolarising muscle relaxant drugs but are resistant to depolarising muscle relaxants. These drugs are used in neonatal anaesthesia to achieve muscle relaxation. Wrong doses given may lead to prolonged duration of action of these agents. Measures should be taken to prevent the neonate from developing hypothermia and acidosis as these will cause delayed recovery from the
non-depolarising muscle relaxant.""

""The few generalist physician anaesthetists working in Africa have to be “all things to all men” and empower themselves with the skills and competencies required to handle a broad
spectrum of complex surgical procedures, including neonatal emergencies. Increase in the number of professionals whose clinical practices converge on the critically ill neonate must be encouraged, advocated and planned for.""

""More involvement of health care providers in advocacy work in the community is required and may result in
beneficial changes in some of the harmful cultural beliefs and practices. Early reporting at health facilities
