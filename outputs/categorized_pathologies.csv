Though increasingly recognised as a growing global health problem, the burden of surgical pathologies and access to surgical care has not been adequately identified in many LIC. Information on the spectrum and burden of surgical disease in Malawi is important to uncover the unmet need for surgery and for planning of the National Health Service. Methods This was a multistage random cluster sampling national survey. Households were selected from clusters using probability proportional to size method. 1448 households and 2909 interviewees were analysed. The Surgeons Overseas Assessment of Surgical need (SOSAS) tool was used to collect data. This electronic tablet based questionnaire tool included general information and a dual personalised head to toe inquiry on surgical conditions. The general information included number of household members, and inquired on any death within the past twelve months, and if any of the deaths in the family had a suspected surgical condition leading to that death. Data was collected by specially trained third year medical students. Results Out of 1480 selected households, 1448 (98%) agreed to participate, with 2909 interviewed individuals included in the study. The median household size was 6 individuals (range 1 - 47). Median age of interviewed persons was 35 years (range 0.25 - 104 years). 1027 out of 2909 (35%) of the interviewed people reported to be living with a condition requiring surgical consultation or intervention, whereas 146 of 616 (24%) of the total deaths reported to have occurred in the preceding 12 months were reported to have died from a surgically related condition. Most individuals did not seek health care due to lack of funds for transportation to the health facility. Only 3.1% of those that reported a surgical condition had surgical intervention. Conclusions There is a large unmet need for surgical care in Malawi.

There are profound disparities in surgical care worldwide, with only 3.5% of surgical procedures estimated to be performed in the poorest 1/3 of countries. Yet, very little is known regarding the true volume of surgical procedures performed in resource-limited settings. Methods: We conducted a retrospective, descriptive study of aggregate district hospital statistics provided to the Ministry of Health in Rwanda from 40 district hospitals over the period from January 2008-September 2010. Results: The total numbers of major procedures performed at the District Hospital level in Rwanda were 23,621 for 2008, 43,389 for 2009, and 32,944 for the first nine months of 2010. Obstetrics and gynecology procedures comprised 75.5%, 60.8%, and 61.4% of major operations in 2008, 2009 and 2010, respectively.

Surgery is often the primary line of treatment and its timing may impact adjuvant medical and/or radiation therapies, influencing negative outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify barriers to timely surgery and describe early surgical outcomes for patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer at two tertiary hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali and Rwanda Military Hospital over 12 a month period from May 2016 to May 2017. RESULTS: 69 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 48 years. 74.16% of patients ≤ 60 years, 58% were premenopausal. 69.5% presented with locally advanced stages. Mean duration of symptoms was 10.9 months before initial consultation. Patients had to wait 91 days (3 months) before surgery. Mean hospital stay was 5 days after surgery and 98.9% underwent modified radical mastectomy. No major complications reported.

The mean cost of these procedures ranged from 60 to 21,140 United States Dollars (USD).

Paediatric burn injuries are among the leading causes of preventable morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. Research on the morbidity and mortality in this setting is much needed. Methods: We conducted a prospective questionnaire-based analysis of paediatric burn patients presenting to the Maputo Central Hospital during a five-month period. Interviews were conducted with the children's caretakers by 2 paediatric surgery residents and 1 paediatrician at the Eduardo Mondlane Medical School in Maputo, with the aid of nursing staff. Results: Questionnaires were completed for 66 patients. Most burns occurred from scald injuries (n = 46), particularly from cooking (n = 27) and bathwater (n = 19), followed by fire injuries (n = 16). Burns occurred more frequently in the afternoon (n = 26) and morning (n = 23). Many patients reported no adult caretaker present at the time of the burn injury (n = 24). Most burns were grade II (n = 49). Nearly half of the patients received a blood transfusion (n = 30). One-third of the patients underwent operative surgical debridement (n = 21). Skin grafting was performed on a subset of these patients (n = 13). A large number of patients developed a wound infection (n = 39). All deaths occurred in patients who were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit and had sepsis (n = 9). The mean total body surface area (TBSA) of burn deaths was 37% (range 20% to 50%), and many deaths were secondary to fire burns (6 of 9; 66.7%). Conclusions: Most paediatric burn injuries occur in association with domestic activities, such as cooking and bathing. Adult caretakers are frequently not present at the time of the burn injury. Mortality rates are high, especially for large body surface area burns caused by fire. Educational programmes may help reduce the incidence of burns and the associated morbidity and mortality. The improvement and expansion of emergency and intensive burn care services may help to improve survival.",2017,NA,East and Central African Journal of Surgery,22,3,7,NA,NA,11525,Amado 2017,NA,Burns; DALYs,"Burden & Outcome, Burns","Burden & Outcome, Burns, Trauma",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Burns,Yes,No,No,No,No,No

Despite the lack of Pediatric Surgeons and Pediatric Anesthesiologists, Kigali and Butare University Teaching Hospitals receive and manage children with surgical conditions. Some of these patients could benefit from the expertise of specialists trained in Pediatric surgical conditions. Purpose: The aim of this study is to describe the pattern of pediatric surgery in Rwanda and to determine the prevalence of pediatric surgical conditions that require the expertise of a Pediatric Surgeon. Methods: This is a retrospective study carried out between August, 2013 and July, 2014. Data were obtained from theater books and operative database. Data analysis was done by SPSS 16 and MS Excel. Results: From August, 2013 to July, 2014, a total number of 1274 children were operated at Butare and Kigali University Teaching Hospitals. 391 (30.7) were female and 883 (69.3) were male, with a male to female ratio of 2.2:1.

P. Osho P. D. Wade U. U. Nnadozie O. S. Ebune","Introduction: Cicatricial ectropion usually occurs following the healing of eyelid wounds from burn injury, other traumas and infections. Most reports are on treatment of lower eyelid ectropion where local flaps are commonly used for reconstruction. In the absence of such flaps, full thickness skin grafts can be used. We present our experience with the use of full thickness graft. Patients and Methods: Patients who had eyelid reconstruction for ectropion between January 2000 and December 2006 at the Jos University Teaching Hospital were reviewed. The information obtained from the operation register as well as the patients’ case notes included demographic data, working diagnosis, aetiology, affected eyelid(s), the type of surgery and associated medical condition. Results: A total of 18 patients were seen, nine males and nine females. Their ages ranged from 1 to 52 years (mean= 20.5 ± 14.3 years). The causes of the ectropion were flame burn in 11 (61.1%), road traffic accident (RTA) in 4 (22.2%), acid burn, herpes zoster and drug reaction in one (5.5%) each. The duration of the development of ectropion and surgery was one month to four years (mean = 0.83 ± 1.2 years). The affected eyelids were upper in twelve (66.6%) patients, lower in 3 (16.7%) and both upper and lower eyelids in 3 (16.7%). The left side was the more affected with 10 (55.5%) patients, the right and bilateral with four (22.2%) patients each. Full thickness skin graft was used in all the reconstructions. One of the patients had a previous reconstruction with split thickness graft. The outcome of the procedure was both functionally and aesthetically good.

J. K.","Background: Contractures are common complications of wounds healing by secondary intention; some cases are idiopathic and a few are congenital. Contractures cause significant morbidity to patients. Objective: The study was undertaken to document the pattern, spectrum and management of patients with contractures of various types and aetiologies presenting at a Plastic and Reconstructive Surgical Unit in Ghana. Design: Prospective study from January 2004 to December 2008. Setting: Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH) in Kumasi Patients and Methods: The age, sex, site, extent and cause of contracture was documented. The patients were examined and functional impairment recorded. A clinical photograph was taken. Patients requiring surgery had their contractures released and the defect repaired with an appropriate reconstructive technique. Patients with minimal functional impairment underwent physical therapy without surgery. Results: Sixty-eight patients comprising 44 males and 24 females were seen. Male to female ratio is 1.83:1. Their ages ranged from 0.66 to 60 years, mean age was 22.53 years. Seventy-six contractures were studied. Fifty-eight of the lesions were in the upper part of the body. Burns, infections and trauma were the main aetiological causes. Seventy-one surgical procedures were performed including release and flap repair (33), full thickness skin graft (23) and partial thickness skins graft and splinting (six). Conclusions: Thermal burns and soft tissue infections are the commonest causes of contractures presenting at KATH in Kumasi.

K.; Niamba, P.; Traore, A.","Background In developing countries, the long delays in consultation lead to a delay in diagnosis and management of the skin tumors. The lesions are often large and bring the problem of skin coverage after their resections. Several reconstruction techniques allow skin coverage. The objective of this study is to describe the place of O-to-Z technique in the surgical treatment of skin cancers in Ouagadougou. We hypothesized that O-to-Z technique reduces healing times and the number of dressings compared with directed wound healing. Patients and methods It was a two-center, retrospective, descriptive study on O-to-Z technique in skin cancers. It included patients who underwent surgery between January 1st, 2013 and March 30th, 2021 in Ouagadougou. Scar quality and healing time in Z-plasty were compared with those of secondary healing. We used the Student's t test. Results In 8 years and 3 months, 171 skin cancers were identified. The mean time to consultation was 13.6 months. The average size of the tumors was 9 cm. An O-to-Z technique was performed in 42 cases, being 58.3% of the patients operated on. The average healing time was 15 days. It was four and a half times shorter in O-to-Z technique than in secondary healing. Ischemic necrosis of the Z-corner was noted in 7 cases. The recurrence rate in O-to-Z technique and secondary healing was 7.1% and 9.1% respectively. Hypertrophic or keloidal scars were noticed in 7 cases and hypochromia in 2 cases. Conclusion O-to-Z technique is a technique of choice for skin coverage after large resections in surgical oncology.

This study sought to estimate the prevalence of thoracic surgical need in a low-income country and consider contributing factors involved. METHODS: Cluster-randomized, cross-sectional nationwide survey using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need tool in Sierra Leone from January 9-February 3, 2012. RESULTS: Data were collected and analyzed from 3645 respondents (response rate 98.3%). 273 (7.5%) reported ≥1 chest (including heart, lungs, and mediastinum) or breast surgical problem during their lifetime; 268 (7.4%) reported ≥1 back complaint. Multiple problems could be reported, resulting in a total of 277 chest/breast and 268 back complaints. The majority (184/545) were related to acquired deformities. Most occurred ≥12 months ago (364/545) and continued to impact the participant at the time of the interview (339/545). 322/545 sought care; however, 40% (130/322) did not receive care, predominately due to an inability to pay. Adjusted logistic regression found that chest/breast problems were more common among farm workers, older participants, and individuals with minimal education, while back problems were more common in the same groups and males. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides data on the prevalence of thoracic surgical conditions and factors affecting prevalence in one of the world's poorest countries.

Hospital-based trauma registries are a critical tool in illustrating injury patterns and clinical outcomes. This study aims to characterize the traumatic injuries presenting to Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) in order to identify opportunities for quality improvement and policy development. From October 2016 to July 2019, we prospectively captured data on injured patients using a locally designed, contextrelevant trauma registry instrument. Information regarding patient demographics, injury characteristics, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were recorded. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted. A total of 4109 injured patients were treated during the study period. Median age was 26 years and 63% were male. Students (33%) and peasant farmers (31%) were the most affected occupations. Falls (36%) and road traffic injuries (RTIs, 35%) were the leading causes of injury. Nearly two-thirds of RTIs were motorcycle-related and only 16% involved a pedestrian. Over half (53%) of all patients had a fracture or a sprain. Suffering a burn or a head injury were significant predictors of mortality. The number of trauma patients enrolled in the study declined by five-fold when comparing the final six months and initial six months of the study. Implementation of a context-appropriate trauma registry in a resource-constrained setting is feasible. In rural Uganda, there is a significant need for injury prevention efforts to protect vulnerable populations such as children and women from trauma on roads and in the home.

The male gender predominated with a sex ratio of 8.5. All patients were victims of intentional assault with stabbing weapon. The weapon used was the machete in all cases. The injuries caused by this trauma were all complex, sometimes involving bone and organ damage. The jugal location predominated (34, 21%). The delay in treatment was most often more than 3 days.

METHODS: We conducted a chart review of children operated for cryptorchidism, isolated cleft lip, hypospadias, bladder exstrophy and anorectal malformation at an Ethiopian referral hospital between January 2012 and July 2016 and a scoping review of the literature describing the management of congenital anomalies in African LMICs. Procedure numbers and age at surgery were collected to estimate mean surgical delays by country and extrapolate surgical backlog. The unmet surgical need was derived from incidence-based disease estimates, established disability weights, and actual surgical volumes. RESULTS: The chart review yielded 210 procedures in 207 patients from Ethiopia. The scoping review generated 42 data sets, extracted from 36 publications, encompassing: Benin, Egypt, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Nigeria, Madagascar, Malawi, Togo, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.

METHODS : A retrospective, descriptive study of 176 injured cases that met the terrorist attacks was conducted. The medical data were collected by an electronic database system. All collected data were entered into an Excel spreadsheet for calculation. RESULTS: We found that improvised explosive devices (114/176, 65%) were the most commonly used weapons of attack in Mali. 68.75% of the injuries (121/176) were classified as 'minor injuries according to Abbreviated Injury Scale score. As one patient may suffer multiple injuries, each location and nature of injuries was counted separately. Surface injuries were the top (116/197, 58.88%), followed by orthopaedic injuries (52/197, 26.39%) and internal injuries (29/197, 14.72%). The extremities were the most frequently injured body parts (144/197, 73.09%). We operated 175 surgeries to deal with the 176 combat-related injuries, which accounted for 40.05% of all 437 surgeries. The surgical debridement to remove fragments of explosive was the most frequently performed surgery. We also admitted 20 cases (18/176, 34%) into intensive care unit and transferred 40 cases to Level 3 medical facility. CONCLUSION : Peacekeepers taking protective measures for head and trunk frequently got surface injuries. And their unprotected extremities often got injured.

METHODS: A simulation model using a decision tree template was developed to project the cost and disability-adjusted life-years saved by a pediatric OR in a low-income setting. Parameters are informed by patient outcomes of the surgical procedures performed. Costs of the OR equipment and a literature review were used to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of a pediatric OR.

METHODS: Community volunteers randomly surveyed households at sites across Kenya. Caretakers were asked to identify on a photographic portfolio, several congenital malformations present among the children in their household, including club foot, hypospadias, hydrocephalus, spina bifida/encephalocele, cleft lip, bladder exstrophy and imperforate anus. DALYs were then calculated based on life expectancy tables and published and estimated disability weights for the conditions encountered.

We sought to assess the prevalence of surgical disease and disability in the elderly population of Sierra Leone to guide future development strategies. METHODS: A cluster randomized, cross-sectional household survey was carried out countrywide in Sierra Leone from January 9th to February 3rd 2012. Using a standardized questionnaire, household member demographics, deaths occurring during the previous 12 months, and presence of any current surgical condition were elucidated. A retrospective analysis of individuals aged 50 and over was performed. RESULTS: The survey included 1,843 households with a total of 3,645 respondents. Of these, 13.6 % (496/3,645) were aged over 50 years. Of the elderly individuals in our sample, 301 (60.7 %) reported a current surgical condition.

The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery's indicators include the population proportion accessing laparotomy and open fracture care, key trauma interventions, within two hours. The ""Golden Hour"" for receiving facility-based resuscitation also guides injury care system strengthening. Firstly, we estimated the proportion of the local population able to reach primary, secondary and tertiary facility care within two and one hours using Geographic Information System (GIS) analysis. Secondly, we compared community household-reported with GIS-estimated travel time. METHODS: Using information from a Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (Karonga, Malawi) on road network, facility location, and local staff-estimated travel speeds, we used a GIS-generated friction surface to calculate the shortest travel time from all households to each facility serving the population. We surveyed community households who reported travel time to their preferred, closest, government secondary and tertiary facilities. For recently injured community members, time to reach facility care was recorded. To assess the relationship between community household-reported travel time and GIS-estimated travel time, we used linear regression to generate a proportionality constant. To assess associations and agreement between injured patient-reported and GIS-estimated travel time, we used Kendall rank and Cohen's kappa tests. RESULTS: Using GIS, we estimated 79.1% of households could reach any secondary facility, 20.5% the government secondary facility, and 0% the government tertiary facility, within two hours. Only 28.2% could reach any secondary facility within one hour, 0% for the government secondary facility. Community household-reported travel time exceeded GIS-estimated travel time. The proportionality constant was 1.25 (95%CI 1.21-1.30) for the closest facility, 1.28 (95%CI 1.23-1.34) for the preferred facility, 1.45 (95%CI 1.33-1.58) for the government secondary facility, and 2.12 (95%CI 1.84-2.41) for tertiary care. Comparing injured patient-reported with GIS-estimated travel time, the correlation coefficient was 0.25 (SE 0.047) and Cohen's kappa was 0.15 (95%CI 0.078-0.23), suggesting poor agreement. DISCUSSION: Most households couldn't reach government secondary care within recognised thresholds indicating poor temporal access. Since GIS-estimated travel time was shorter than community-reported travel time, the true proportion may be lower still. GIS derived estimates of population emergency care access in similar contexts should be interpreted accordingly.",2022,NA,Injury,53,5,1690-1698,35153068,10.1016/j.injury.2022.02.010,13408,Whitaker 2022,NA,Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care,Access & Barriers,"Access & Barriers, Trauma",No,Yes,No,Yes,No,No,Trauma,No,Yes,No,No,No,No

Results Significant barriers to care identified in SSA include lack of hospital resources, craniofacial training, access to multidisciplinary specialists, and public awareness. These problems make the entire care journey difficult for patients. Increasing public education has the power to diminish late presentations to hospitals. Providing adequate hospital resources and craniofacial training through international and organizational partnerships can ensure that more patients will receive care.

H.","Objective To study paediatric surgery rates in south-western Uganda, compare them to rates in England, and determine if existing surgical facilities and workforce meet World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Methods To obtain information on surgical facilities and workforce, we conducted a cross-sectional survey of all hospitals performing major surgery in 14 districts of south-western Uganda in 2007-2008. Using theatre logbook data, we determined the surgical rates, types of surgery performed and in-theatre surgical outcomes. Findings Of 72 hospitals surveyed, 29 were performing major surgery. None met WHO standards for essential surgery. There were 0.7 accredited surgeons per 100 000 population and no paediatric surgeons. Most anaesthetists were not physicians (accredited anaesthetist per 100 000 population: 1.1). The annual surgical rate for children aged ≤ 14 years was 180 operations per 100 000 population; most were emergency procedures. The annual surgical rate for patients of all ages was 652 operations per 100 000 population, with a median of 422 per operating theatre (range: 60-3497) and of 226 per surgeon (range: 60-1748). Mission or nongovernmental organization (NGO) hospitals, which had 44% of the hospital beds in the region, performed 3039 (55%) of the paediatric operations. Externally funded surgeons performed 80% of the 140 cleft lip and palate operations. Four in-theatre deaths occurred in children ≤ 14 years old (in-theatre mortality: 7.7 deaths per 10 000 operations). Conclusion Access to all surgery, including paediatric surgery, is poor in south-western Uganda and investment in basic health-care facilities and surgical workforce and training is urgently needed. Mission and NGO hospitals make a valuable contribution to elective surgery, and externally funded surgeons make an important contribution to specialist surgery.

Treating children with surgical conditions may reduce long-term effects of morbidity and disability. Unfortunately, low- and middle-income countries have limited resources for paediatric surgical care. Malawi, for example, has very few paediatric surgeons. There are also significantly inadequate infrastructures and personnel to treat these children. In order to strengthen resources that could provide such services, we need to begin by quantifying the need. Aim To estimate the approximate prevalence of surgical conditions among children in Malawi, to describe the anatomical locations and diagnoses of the conditions and the presence of injuries. Methods A cross-sectional, nationwide survey of surgical needs was performed in 28 of 29 districts of Malawi. Villages, households and household members were randomly selected. A total of 1487 households were visited and 2960 persons were interviewed. This paper is a sub analysis of the children in the dataset. Information was obtained from 255 living children and inquiry from household respondents for the 255 children who had died in the past year. The interviews were conducted by medical students over a 60-day period, and the validated SOSAS tool was used for data collection. Results There were 67 out of 255 (26.3%) total children living with a surgical condition at the time of the study, with most of the conditions located in the extremities. Half of the children lived with problems due to injuries. Traffic accidents were the most common cause. Two-thirds of the children living with a surgical condition had some kind of disability, and one-third of them were grossly disabled. There were 255 total deceased children, with 34 who died from a surgical condition. The most prevalent causes of death were congenital anomalies of the abdomen, groin and genital region. Conclusion An extrapolation of the 26% of children found to be living with a surgical condition indicates that there could be 2 million children living with a condition that needs surgical consultation or treatment in Malawi. Congenital anomalies cause significant numbers of deaths among Malawian children. Children living with surgical conditions had disorders in their extremities, causing severe disability.

A.; Grp, Pressco Study","Background Understanding the burden of diseases requiring surgical care at national levels is essential to advance universal health coverage. The PREvalence Study on Surgical COnditions (PRESSCO) 2020 is a cross-sectional household survey to estimate the prevalence of physical conditions needing surgical consultation, to investigate healthcare-seeking behavior, and to assess changes from before the West African Ebola epidemic. Methods This study (ISRCTN: 12353489) was built upon the Surgeons Overseas Surgical Needs Assessment (SOSAS) tool, including expansions. Seventy-five enumeration areas from 9671 nationwide clusters were sampled proportional to population size. In each cluster, 25 households were randomly assigned and visited. Need for surgical consultations was based on verbal responses and physical examination of selected household members. Results A total of 3,618 individuals from 1,854 households were surveyed. Compared to 2012, the prevalence of individuals reporting one or more relevant physical conditions was reduced from 25 to 6.2% (95% CI 5.4-7.0%) of the population. One-in-five conditions rendered respondents unemployed, disabled, or stigmatized. Adult males were predominantly prone to untreated surgical conditions (9.7 vs. 5.9% women; p < 0.001). Financial constraints were the predominant reason for not seeking care. Among those seeking professional health care, 86.7% underwent surgery. Conclusion PRESSCO 2020 is the first surgical needs household survey which compares against earlier study data. Despite the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak, which profoundly disrupted the national healthcare system, a substantial reduction in reported surgical conditions was observed. Compared to one-time measurements, repeated household surveys yield finer granular data on the characteristics and situations of populations in need of surgical treatment.",2022,NA,World J.Surg.,46,11,2585-2594,WOS:000850379800003,10.1007/s00268-022-06695-7,23973,vanKesteren 2022,Saidu Ahmad Idris (2025-01-23 07:32:00)(Select): Include the prevalence of hard/soft masses and burn cases.; Sabina Rodriguez (2025-01-23 04:47:55)(Select): Reports on surgical conditions and does provide stratification (at least specification of which condition);,Barriers to Care; Burden,"Access & Barriers, Burden & Outcome",Burden & Outcome,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No,Other,No,No,No,No,No,Yes

Most children with a surgical emergency are treated by nonspecialist rural providers. We describe the design and implementation of a locally driven, pilot pediatric emergency surgical care course to strengthen skills of these providers. This is the first description of such a course in the current literature. Methods: The course was delivered three times from 2018 to 2019. Modules include perioperative management, neonatal emergencies, intestinal emergencies, and trauma. A baseline needs assessment survey was administered. Participants in the second and third courses also took pre and postcourse knowledge-based tests. Results: Forty-five providers representing multiple cadres participated. Participants most commonly perform hernia/hydrocele repair (17% adjusted rating) in their current practice and are least comfortable managing cleft lip and palate (mean Likert score 1.4 ± 0.9). Equipment shortage was identified as the most significant challenge to delivering pediatric surgical care (24%). Scores on the knowledge tests improved significantly from pre- (55.4% ± 22.4%) to postcourse (71.9% ± 14.0%, p < 0.0001).

Although BU disease has been diagnosed among Nigerians in neighbouring West African countries, data on the burden of the disease in Nigeria itself are scanty. This study aimed to assess the magnitude and epidemiology of BU in the South South region of Nigeria. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in the Ogoja territory (comprising 31 communities). We undertook sensitisation programmes centred on BU in 10 of the communities. Participants were asked to identify community members with long-standing ulcers, who were then invited for evaluation. We also contacted traditional healers to refer their clients who had non-healing ulcers. All suspected cases had a full clinical evaluation and laboratory testing. Confirmed cases were given treatment in a referral hospital in the territory. Results: We diagnosed 41 clinical BU cases; 36 (87.8 %) of which were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). These 36 PCR-confirmed cases were diagnosed in a total population of 192,169 inhabitants. Therefore, the estimated crude prevalence of BU was 18.7 per 100,000 population, varying from 6.0 to 41.4 per 100,000 in the districts surveyed. The majority (66.7 %) of the cases were females. About 92 % of the BU lesions were located on the patients' extremities. No differences were observed between the sexes in terms of the location of the lesions. The age of the patients ranged from four to 60 years, with a median age of 17 years. All 35 (100 %) patients who consented to treatment completed chemotherapy as prescribed. Of the treated cases, 29 (82.9 %) needed and received surgery. All cases healed, but 29 (82.9 %) had some limitations in movement. Healing with limitations in movement occurred in 18/19 (94.7 %) and 8/10 (80.0 %) of patients with lesions >15 cm (Category III) and 6-15 cm in diameter (Category II), respectively. The median duration of treatment was 130 (87-164) days for children and 98 (56-134) days for adults (p = 0.15).

The purpose of this study was to determine the presentation, systemic and local predisposing factors, management challenges and outcome in south-eastern Nigeria. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 28 out of 34 consecutive male patients with complete case notes seen in two centres (the University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital and St Mary's Hospital) between January 1995 and December 2008. Operating theatre registers and urology ward admission registers were used to identify patients. RESULTS: The mean patient age was 48.3 years (range 28 - 66 years), with a peak age incidence of 50 - 59 years. The majority of patients were farmers, manual labourers and artisans. The site of gangrene was scrotal in 22 patients (78.6%), penoscrotal in 3 (10.7%), abdominoscrotal in 2 (7.1%) and scroto-perianal in 1 (3.6%). The mean interval between onset of symptoms and presentation was 7.2 days (range 3 - 14 days). Systemic predisposing factors identified were diabetes mellitus in 6 patients (21.4%), filariasis in 2 (7.2%), congestive cardiac failure in 1 (3.6%) and HIV infection in 1 (3.6%). In 18 patients (64.3%) no systemic factor was identified. Local predisposing factors identified were chronic scrotal skin itching in 16 patients (57.1%), scrotal thorn injury in 2 (7.1%) and urethral catheterisation in 2 (7.1%). Scrotal carbuncle and scrotal surgery each accounted for 2 patients (7.1%), and zipper injury and ischiorectal abscess occurred in 1 patient each (3.6%). No local predisposing factor was identified in 1 patient (3.6%). The common clinical features were fever, scrotal swelling/pain, and later a malodorous painless wound. Treatment involved fluid administration, correction of electrolyte imbalance, antibiotics, debridement and daily wound inspection/dressing with hydrogen peroxide soaks and sodium hypochlorite. The mean duration of hospital stay was 37.1.days (range 21 - 84 days). One patient died (3.6%). CONCLUSION: Fournier's gangrene is a challenging surgical problem, with significant morbidity.

Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is a serious and potentially life-threatening complication of diabetes. Significant improvements in diabetic foot incidence and outcomes have been recorded in many Western countries in the past decade. However, the current burden of DFU in Nigeria is largely unknown. AIM To evaluate the patients’ profile, ulcer characteristics, associated co-morbidities and outcome of patients with DFU in Nigeria. METHODS Multicenter evaluation of diabetic foot ulcer in Nigeria was a one year multicenter observational study of patients hospitalized for DFU in six tertiary health institutions in Nigeria from March 2016 to March 2017. Demographic and diabetes information, ulcer characteristics and associated co-morbidities were assessed. Relevant laboratory and imaging studies were performed. All patients received appropriate multi-disciplinary care and were followed up until discharge or death. Outcome variables of interest were ulcer healing, lower extremity amputation (LEA), duration of hospitalization and mortality. RESULTS A total of 336 patients (55.1% male) with mean age of 55.9 ± 12.5 years were enrolled into this study. Majority (96.1%) had type 2 diabetes. Only 25.9% of the subjects had prior foot care knowledge. Most of the subjects presented late to the hospital and median (IQR) duration of ulcer at presentation was 39 (28-54) d. Ulcers were already advanced (Wagner grades ≥ 3) in 79.2% of the subjects while 76.8% of the ulcers were infected at the time of admission. The commonest co-morbidities were systemic hypertension, anemia and hyperglycemic emergencies. One hundred and nineteen subjects (35.4%) suffered LEA while 10.4% left against medical advice. The median (IQR) duration of hospitalization was 52.0 (29-66) d with case fatality rate of 20.5%. CONCLUSION The burden of DFU in Nigeria is very high.

The socioeconomic settings of developing countries are different from those in the developed countries. A review of the epidemiology and management of burns in the neonates in Lagos, Nigeria is presented. Methods: The case notes of burns in patients less than 29 days-old from 2004 to 2008 in 4 tertiary health institutions in Lagos were retrieved from the Medical Records Department; necessary data were extracted and analyzed. Results: There were 21 neonates with burns within the study period. The incidence of neonatal burns ranged between 0.5 and 2.5%/year. The mean age was 16.38 ± 1.84 days and the mean BSA of 26.00 ± 5.53%. The etiology of burns was thermal in 19(90.5%) and chemical in 2(9.5%). Hypokalemia was common at early stages of their treatment. Burns were sustained at home in 90.5% of the cases. The mortality rate was 43.5%. Inhalation and thermal injuries were associated with most of the deaths. Conclusion: Domestic incidents from flames are the commonest causes of neonatal burns in the study environment. These are associated with prolonged morbidity and high mortality rate. Health education, highlighting methods of prevention should be undertaken in the community.

Twelve cases did not require treatment while others were managed by either closed or open reduction under general anesthesia. Gillies' temporal approach was the commonest (57.1%) surgical technique employed. However the unstable nature of the fractures necessitated open reduction and transosseous wiring in 33 cases. The high prevalence of zygomatic complex fractures arising from vehicular accidents reflects the poor status of the road network in rural and suburban Nigerian communities.

Delegating some surgical tasks to non-physician clinical officers can mitigate the dependence of a health system on highly skilled clinicians for specific services. METHODS: We performed a case-control study examining pediatric surgical cases over a 12 month period. Operating surgeon was categorized as physician or clinical officer. Operative acuity, surgical subspecialty, and outcome were then compared between the two groups, using physicians as the control. RESULTS: A total of 1186 operations were performed on 1004 pediatric patients. Mean age was 6 years (±5) and 64% of patients were male. Clinical officers performed 40% of the cases. Most general surgery, urology and congenital cases were performed by physicians, while most ENT, neurosurgery, and burn surgery cases were performed by clinical officers. Reoperation rate was higher for patients treated by clinical officers (17%) compared to physicians (7.1%), although this was attributable to multiple burn surgical procedures. Physician and clinical officer cohorts had similar complication rates (4.5% and 4.0%, respectively) and mortality rates (2.5% and 2.1%, respectively).

G.","Background Burns are among the most devastating of all injuries and a major global public health crisis, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, aggressive management of burns continues to lower overall mortality and increase lethal total body surface area (TBSA) at which 50% of patients die (LA50). However, lack of resources and inadequate infrastructure significantly impede such improvements in developing countries. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the burn center at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi between June 2011 and December 2012. We collected information including patient age, gender, date of admission, mechanism of injury, time to presentation to hospital, total body surface area (TBSA) burn, comorbidities, date and type of operative procedures, date of discharge, length of hospital stay, and survival. We then performed bivariate analysis and logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with increased mortality. Results A total of 454 patients were admitted during the study period with a median age of 4 years (range 0.5 months to 79 years). Of these patients, 53% were male. The overall mean TBSA was 18.5%, and average TBSA increased with age - 17% for 0-18 year olds, 24% for 19-60 year olds, and 41% for patients over 60 years old. Scald and flame burns were the commonest mechanisms, 52% and 41% respectively, and flame burns were associated with higher mortality. Overall survival in this population was 82%; however survival reduced with increasing age categories (84% in patients 0-18 years old, 79% in patients 19-60 years old, and 36% in patients older than 60 years). TBSA remained the strongest predictor of mortality after adjusting for age and mechanism of burn. The LA50 for this population was 39% TBSA. Discussion Our data reiterate that burn in Malawi is largely a pediatric disease and that the high burn mortality and relatively low LA50 have modestly improved over the past two decades. The lack of financial resources, health care personnel, and necessary infrastructure will continue to pose a significant challenge in this developing nation.

The scale of the problem including preventable progression to chronic wounds, disability and systemic complications is largely unaddressed. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study combining active (household-based survey) and passive case finding (health services-based survey) to determine the burden and clinical epidemiology of wounds within the Taabo Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in rural Côte d’Ivoire. Patients identified with wounds received free care and were invited to participate in the wound management study simultaneously carried out in the survey area. The data were analysed for wound prevalence, stratified by wound and patient characteristics. Results 3842 HDSS-registered persons were surveyed. Overall wound prevalence derived from combined active and passive case finding was 13.0%. 74.1% (403/544) of patients were below the age of 15 years. Most frequent aetiologies were mechanical trauma (85.3%), furuncles (5.1%), burns (2.9%) and Buruli ulcer (2.2%). Most wounds were acute and smaller than 5 cm2 in size. 22.0% (176/799) of wounds showed evidence of secondary bacterial infection. 35.5% (22/62) of chronic wounds had persisted entirely neglected for years. Buruli ulcer prevalence was 2.3 per 1000 individuals and considerably higher than expected from an annual incidence of 0.01 per 1000 individuals as reported by WHO for Côte d’Ivoire at the time of the study. Conclusions Skin wounds are highly prevalent in rural West Africa, where they represent a widely neglected problem. The HDSS-based survey with combined active and passive case finding adopted in this study provides a better estimate than school- and health institution-based surveys which underestimate the frequency of skin wounds and, particularly, of neglected tropical diseases of the skin, such as Buruli ulcer and yaws.

Rural communities have limited access to high quality health services-based wound care. Methods We conducted a prospective observational study on wound management at three levels– community (C), health centre (HC), district hospital (DH)—in a rural community of Côte d’Ivoire. Patients with skin wounds actively identified in a house-to-house survey and pas-sively in the health services in a defined area of the Taabo Health and Demographic Surveillance System were asked to participate and followed-up longitudinally. Endpoints were proportion of wounds closed, time to wound closure, wound size over time, frequency of secondary bacterial infection, need for recapturing after follow-up interruption, and duration of treatment stratified by health service level and wound aetiology. Results We enrolled 561 patients with 923 wounds between May 2019 and March 2020. The observation period ended in March 2021. Median age was 10 years (IQR 7–15), 63.0% of patients were male.

Our hypotheses were that the age of presentation to screening clinics will decrease between 2006 and 2012, and the geospatial distribution of cases will expand to a more rural catchment area. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal cross-sectional/geospatial distribution study. METHODS: An online, secure database was created from intake forms for children with cleft lip-cleft palate (N=604) in Zimbabwe (2006-2012). Univariate analysis was completed. A linear regression model was fitted to test the time trend of a child's age at the time of presentation. Unique patient addresses (n=411) were matched. Maps presenting cleft diagnosis and presentation year were created with geographic information systems (GIS) software. RESULTS: The median age of presentation was greater for isolated cleft palate (4.2 years, n=106) than isolated cleft lip (1.5 years, n=251) and cleft lip-cleft palate (2.0 years, n=175). Cleft lip cases were mostly left sided with equal gender distribution. The overall age of presentation remained stable (P=.83). The age of children with isolated cleft palate decreased by 0.8 years per surgical trip (P=.01), suggesting the prevalence of unrepaired cleft palate is decreasing due to local and visiting surgeons. The catchment area extended to a less populous area, but clustered around Harare and Bulawayo. CONCLUSIONS: This study gives Zimbabwe-specific evidence that supports reports of the persistent burden of disease requiring attention. The GIS software provided data for the primary needs assessment, which will direct communication to healthcare providers and prospective patients outside of the current catchment area.

Because they may not be able to escape from the burning object, they often experience a long duration of contact with the hot substance, with a resultant deep burn injury and death. Methods: Institutional cross-sectional study was used to study 375 hospitalized burn injury survivor pediatrics from 2015 to 2019. A simple random sampling method was used to select participants. Data were exported from Epidata version 4.6 to SPSS version 25 for analysis. In multivariable analysis, significant of the variables were considered at p-value of <= 0.05. Results: In total, 353 were included in the study. Of 353 burn injury survivors, the prevalence of pathological scar was 125 (35.4%). In multivariable analysis, depth of bum injury, time since bum injury, a patient who have a referred to physiotherapy by the surgeon, and surgical procedure is done after burn were statistically significant with a complication of burn injury survivors. Conclusion and Recommendation: This study revealed that the burden of pathological scar among survivors of burn injury was unacceptably high, which needs intervention from the concerned bodies. Since this high burden of complication might result from the limitation of applying Interburn recommendation, the Amhara regional health bureau and the South Gondar health department shall work in collaboration with Interburn to provide essential burn care and advanced burn care training for health care providers. The timely intervention of those who have a second- and third-degree burn, promoting early presentation to hospital, providing appropriate physiotherapy, and proper care for those who have surgical intervention may help to decrease pathological scar for burn victim children.",2021,NA,Chronic Wound Care Manag.

In Uganda, there is a paucity of comprehensive data describing the burden of pediatric trauma, which is essential for resource allocation and surgical workforce planning. This study aimed to ascertain the burden of non-adolescent pediatric trauma across four Ugandan hospitals. METHODS: We performed a descriptive review of four independent and prospective pediatric surgical databases in Uganda: Mulago National Referral Hospital (2012-2019), Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (2015-2019), Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) (2016-2019), and St Mary's Hospital Lacor (SMHL) (2016-2019). We sub-selected all clinical encounters that involved trauma. The primary outcome was the distribution of injury mechanisms. Secondary outcomes included operative intervention and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There was a total of 693 pediatric trauma patients, across four hospital sites: Mulago National Referral Hospital (n = 245), Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (n = 29), SRRH (n = 292), and SMHL (n = 127). The majority of patients were male (63%), with a median age of 5 [interquartile range = 2, 8]. Chiefly, patients suffered blunt injury mechanisms, including falls (16.2%) and road traffic crashes (14.7%) resulting in abdominal trauma (29.4%) and contusions (11.8%). At SRRH and SMHL, from which orthopedic data were available, 27% of patients suffered long-bone fractures. Overall, 55% of patients underwent surgery and 95% recovered to discharge.

S.","INTRODUCTION: the burden of diseases amenable to surgery, obstetrics, trauma, and anesthesia (SOTA) care is increasing globally but low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed National Surgical, Obstetrics, and Anesthesia Plans as national policies to reduce the global SOTA burden. These plans are dependent on comprehensive stakeholder engagement and health policy analysis. Objective: in this study, we analyzed existing national health policies and events in Cameroon to identify opportunities for SOTA policies. METHODS: we searched the Cameroonian Ministry of Health´s health policy database to identify past and current policies. Next, the policies were retrieved and screened for mentions of SOTA-related interventions using relevant keywords in French and English, and analyzed using the 'eight-fold path´ framework for public policy analysis. RESULTS: we identified 136 policies and events and excluded 16 duplicates. The health policies and events included were implemented between 1967 and 2021. Fifty-nine policies and events (49.2%) mentioned SOTA care: governance (n=25), infrastructure (n=21), service delivery (n=11), workforce (n=11), information management (n=10), and funding (n=8). Most policies and events focused on maternal and neonatal health, followed by anesthesia, ophthalmologic surgery, and trauma. National, multinational civil society organizations and private stakeholders supported these policies and events, and the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health was the largest funder. CONCLUSION: most Cameroonian SOTA-related policies and events focus on maternal and neonatal care, and health financing is the health system component with the least policies and events.

W.; Geneti, S. A.","BACKGROUND: Most amputees suffered from lack of rehabilitation services and went on streets as glorified beggars. However, there is a paucity of information about determinant causes of amputation in Ethiopia. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to estimate pooled prevalence of limb amputation and its determinant causes in Ethiopian population. METHODS: Worldwide databases such as PubMed/MedLine, Web of Science, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, and Science Direct were searched to retrieve pertinent articles. Grey literatures were also looked in local and national repositories. Microsoft excel was used to extract data which were exported to stata version 14.0 for analysis. Cochrane Q and I(2) tests were used to assess heterogeneity. Egger's and Begg's tests were employed to assess reporting biases. Random effect meta-analysis model was applied to estimate pooled prevalence. RESULTS: Twenty-one qualified studies with 18,900 study participants were reviewed. Pooled prevalence of limb amputation was 31.69%. Lower extremity amputation (LEA) accounted for 14.41%, and upper extremity amputation (UEA) took 10.53% (6.50, 14.53). Above knee amputations (2.50 %) were common orthopedic operations whereas ray amputations (0.03%) were the least orthopedic procedures of LEA. Above elbow amputations (2.46%) were common from UEA while shoulder disarticulations (0.02%) were the least orthopedic surgical procedures. The major causes of limb amputations were trauma (11.05%), diabetic foot ulcer (9.93 %), traditional bone setters (24.10%) and burn (10.63%).

However, serial assessments to determine the effect of capacity improvements or changes over time have rarely been performed. OBJECTIVE To compare the availability of trauma care resources in Ghana between 2004 and 2014 to assess the effects of a decade of change in the trauma care landscape and derive recommendations for improvements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Capacity assessmentswere performed using direct inspection and structured interviews derived from theWorld Health Organization's Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care. In Ghana, 10 hospitals in 2004 and 32 hospitals in 2014 were purposively sampled to represent those most likely to care for injuries. Clinical staff, administrators, logistic/procurement officers, and technicians/biomedical engineers who interacted, directly or indirectly, with trauma care resources were interviewed at each hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Availability of items for trauma carewas rated from 0 (complete absence) to 3 (fully available). Factors contributing to deficiency in 2014 were determined for items rated lower than 3. Each item rated lower than 3 at a specific hospital was defined as a hospital-item deficiency. Scores for total number of hospital-item deficiencies were derived for each contributing factor. RESULTS There were significant improvements in mean ratings for trauma care resources: district-level (smaller) hospitals had a mean rating of 0.8 for all items in 2004 vs 1.3 in 2014 (P =.002); regional (larger) hospitals had a mean rating of 1.1 in 2004 vs 1.4 in 2014 (P =.01). However, a number of critical deficiencies remain (eg, chest tubes, diagnostics, and orthopedic and neurosurgical care; mean ratings≤2). Leading contributing factors were item absence (503 hospital-item deficiencies), lack of training (335 hospital-item deficiencies), and stockout of consumables (137 hospital-item deficiencies). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There has been significant improvement in trauma care capacity during the past decade in Ghana; however, critical deficiencies remain and require urgent redress to avert preventable death and disability.

SETTING: Eight primary HCs in South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia. PARTICIPANTS: Eight health officers and nurses staffing eight HCs completed a survey. DESIGN: The study was a survey-based, cross-sectional assessment of HCs in South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia and data were collected over a 30-day period from November 2014 to January 2015. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Survey assessed human and material resources, diagnostic capabilities and challenges and patient-reported barriers to care. RESULTS: Eight HCs had an average of 18 providers each, the majority of which were nurses (62.2%) and health officers (20.7%). HCs had intermittent availability of clean water, nasogastric tubes, rectal tubes and suturing materials, none of them had any form of imaging. A total of 168 surgical patients were seen at the 8 HCs; 58% were referred for surgery. Most common diagnoses were trauma/burns (42%) and need for caesarean section (9%). Of those who did not receive surgery, 32 patients reported specific barriers to obtaining care (91.4%). The most common specific barriers were patients not being decision makers to have surgery, lack of family/social support and inability to afford hospital fees. CONCLUSIONS: HCs in South Wollo Zone, Ethiopia are well-staffed with nurses and health officers, however they face a number of diagnostic and treatment challenges due to lack of material resources. Many patients requiring surgery receive initial diagnosis and care at HCs; sociocultural and financial factors commonly prohibit these patients from receiving surgery. Further study is needed to determine how such delays may impact patient outcomes.

Methods: A retrospective study of all neonates who had emergency surgery over a 10-year period at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Results: There were 72 males and 38 females. The age at presentation ranged between 2 h to 30 days (mean ± SD: 6.62 ± 7.14 days). The weight at presentation was 1.3 to 3.9 kg (mean ± SD: 2.62 ± 0.53 kg). The mean birthweight of the survivors (mean ± SD: 2.84 ± 0.44 kg) was significantly higher than those that died (mean ± SD: 2.26 ± 0.49 kg) (P < 0.01). The mean interval to surgery from onset of symptoms in the survivors (mean ± SD: 42.720 ± 41.769 h) compared well to those that died (mean ± SD: 51.85 ± 65.52 h) (P = 0.424). The admission weight, duration of operation, level of gastrointestinal obstruction and type of operation significantly influenced the outcome. Closure of ruptured exomphalos, thoracostomy with oesophageal anastomosis, and intestinal resection with anastomosis are associated with high mortality. Sepsis/septicaemia was the commonest postoperative complications accounting for 16 deaths. Overall, there were 59 deaths (53.6%). Conclusion: The morbidity and mortality following emergency surgical management of the neonate is still very high in this environment. Lower admission weight, long duration of operation, type of operation performed and presence of upper gastrointestinal obstruction are significantly associated with increased neonatal surgical mortality in our hospital. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 College of Surgeons of Hong Kong.",2007,NA,Surgical Practice,11,2,71-75,NA,10.1111/j.1744-1633.2007.00341.x,22289,Sowande 2007,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-15 21:57:03)(Select): mainly gastrointestinal anomalies. however; addresses barriers to neonatal surgical care. ; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-15 01:37:59)(Select): Includes reconstructive surgical conditions, ulcer healing and limb amputation; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-15 01:37:14)(Select): The full text id free to read but downloading is disabled;",Burden; Children / Pediatric Population,"Burden & Outcome, Population",Burden & Outcome,Yes,No,No,No,No,No,Congenital Malformations,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

Our goal was to quantify the burden of disease related to delays to surgical care for children with congenital surgical conditions in Somaliland. METHODS: We collected data from medical records on all children (n = 280) receiving surgery for a proxy set of congenital conditions over a 12-month time period across all 15 surgically equipped hospitals in Somaliland. We defined delay to surgical care for each condition as the difference between the ideal and the actual ages at the time of surgery. Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) attributable to these delays were calculated and compared by the type of condition, travel distance to care, and demographic characteristics. RESULTS: We found long delays in surgical care for these 280 children with congenital conditions, translating to a total of 2970 attributable delayed DALYs, or 8.4 avertable delayed DALYs per child, with the greatest burden among children with neurosurgical and anorectal conditions. Over half of the families seeking surgical care had to travel over 2 h to a surgically equipped hospital in the capital city of Hargeisa. CONCLUSIONS: Children with congenital conditions in Somaliland experience substantial delays to surgical care and travel long distances to obtain care.

The organization supports surgeries in several countries that experience high levels of regional conflict and violence. Nigeria, a country where Smile Train is very active, has undergone numerous periods of extreme violence over the past 12 years. The purpose of the present study is to analyze how local violence and conflict have impacted the ability of surgeons partnered with Smile Train to provide care in Nigeria. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed Smile Train Express, the organization's database, from 2003 to 2015 for cleft lip/palate repairs performed in Nigeria. The data was chronologically mapped against a detailed timeline of incidents of violence in Nigeria to compare how violence affected the work of Smile Train-affiliated surgeons. RESULTS: Smile Train-affiliates facilitated 11,499 surgeries in Nigeria from 2003 to 2015. During the same period, 46,370 people were killed in Nigeria in acts of terrorism and violence. Major drops in the frequency of cleft surgeries were preceded by spikes in violence.

M.; Juillard, C.","BACKGROUND: Road traffic injuries (RTIs) are a cause of significant morbidity and mortality in low- and middle-income countries. Access to timely emergency services is needed to decrease the morbidity and mortality of RTIs and other traumatic injuries. Our objective was to describe the distribution of roadtrafficcrashes (RTCs) in Nairobi with the relative distance and travel times for victims of RTCs to health facilities with trauma surgical capabilities. METHODS: RTCs in Nairobi County were recorded by the Ma3route app from May 2015 to October 2015 with latitude and longitude coordinates for each RTC extracted using geocoding. Health facility administrators were interviewed to determine surgical capacity of their facilities. RTCs and health facilities were plotted on maps using ArcGIS. Distances and travel times between RTCs and health facilities were determined using the Google Maps Distance Matrix API. RESULTS: 89 percent (25/28) of health facilities meeting inclusion criteria were evaluated. Overall, health facilities were well equipped for trauma surgery with 96% meeting WHO Minimal Safety Criteria. 76 percent of facilities performed greater than 12 of three pre-selected 'Bellweather Procedures' shown to correlate with surgical capability. The average travel time and distance from RTCs to the nearest health facilities surveyed were 7 min and 3.4 km, respectively. This increased to 18 min and 9.6 km if all RTC victims were transported to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH). CONCLUSION: Almost all hospitals surveyed in the present study have the ability to care for trauma patients. Treating patients directly at these facilities would decrease travel time compared with transfer to KNH. Nairobi County could benefit from formally coordinating the triage of trauma patients to more facilities to decrease travel time and potentially improve patient outcomes.

Some cases are resistant to conservative treatment. Many causes of resistance have been reported, among these, the presence of anomalous muscles; however, the effect of the presence of anomalous muscles on the outcome of conservative management is not well studied. These aberrant muscles are discovered during the extensive surgical release as an abnormal finding.

Also, we introduce a new observation as an indication by which the surgeon can predict the presence of FDAL. On the basis of an observation that there is a special posture of the big toe in extension in relation to other flexed toes associated with the presence of FDAL, records of patients of clubfoot treated by extensive surgery between 2007 and 2012 at the Sudan Clubfoot Project were reviewed. Demographic characteristics were studied. Only patients with idiopathic TEV were included. Resistant clubfeet necessitated extensive release in 261 patients, 197 males and 64 females.

This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile of polytrauma and outline the distribution of extremity fractures among cases in Northern Ghana. Methods. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tamale Teaching Hospital. Data were extracted using a data collection tool onto MS Excel, cleaned, and exported onto SPSS version 26 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to present data in tables and charts. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess whether there was a significant difference in the mean ISS and mean length of stay of the direct causes of death. Results. About 186 out of 5413 attendants to the emergency department were polytrauma, period prevalence of 3.4%. The male-to-female ratio was 1.9 : 1. Young adults (21-40 years) contributed 64% of the participants. The mean age of participants was 32.9 +/- 15.4 years, and the mean ISS was 40.6 +/- 13.1. Road traffic accidents (68.8%) were the most common cause of polytrauma. The mortality was 33.0%. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was the most common direct cause of mortality (54.1%). There was a significant mean difference (MD) in the length of stay between multiple organ failure (MOF) and TBI (MD = 3.169, 95% C.I. = 0.48-5.86) and between MOF and hemorrhage (MD = 6.212, 95% C.I. = 2.62-9.80). Most fractures were closed (75.3%) and affected the lower limbs (61.5%). Open reduction and internal fixation were the most common surgery for extremity fractures. Conclusion.

J.; MacPherson, P.","Background: Injuries are a major cause of disability globally and injury incidence is rapidly increasing, largely due to road traffic injuries in low-income and middle-income countries. Current estimates of the scale and consequences of disability from injury are largely based on modelling studies, with a scarcity of empirical evidence from severe injuries in low-income countries. We aimed to better understand the outcomes for individuals with open tibia fractures in Malawi. Methods: In this multicentre, prospective cohort study, adults (aged ≥18 years) with open tibia fractures were systematically recruited at six hospitals in Malawi (two tertiary hospitals and four district hospitals). Follow-up lasted at least 1 year, during which in-person follow-up reviews were done at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year post-injury. The primary outcome was function at 1 year post-injury, measured by the Short Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (SMFA) score. Secondary outcomes included quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs; as determined via the European Quality of Life 5-Dimensions 3-Levels [EQ-5D-3L] survey) and fracture-related infection at 1 year post-injury. Multilevel regression models investigated associations between SMFA score, EQ-5D-3L, baseline factors, and orthopaedic management. Findings: Between Feb 12, 2021, and March 14, 2022, 287 participants were enrolled (median age 34 years [IQR 25–44]; 84% male). The most common mode of injury was road traffic injuries (194 [68%] of 287). Overall, 268 (93%) participants had debridement; of the 63 participants who were debrided in district hospitals, 47 (75%) had the procedure under local or no anaesthesia. Following substantial declines by 6 weeks after injury, function and quality of life had not recovered by 1 year post-injury for participants with Gustilo grade I–II fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 10·5, 95% highest density interval [HDI]: 9·5–11·6; QALYs: 0·73, 95% HDI: 0·66–0·80) nor Gustilo grade III fractures (posterior mean SMFA at 1 year: 14·9, 95% HDI: 13·4–16·6; QALYs: 0·67, 95% HDI: 0·59–0·75). For all fracture grades, intramedullary nailing substantially improved function and quality of life at 1 year post-injury. Delayed definitive fixation after 5 days had 5-times greater odds of infection compared with early management within 2 days (adjusted odds ratio: 5·1, 95% CI 1·8–16·1; p=0·02). Interpretation: Adults with open tibia fractures in Malawi have poor function and quality of life in the 1 year following injury. Centralised orthopaedic surgical management, including early definitive fixation and intramedullary nailing for more severe injuries, might improve outcomes. Funding: Wellcome Trust.

Growing the surgical workforce is crucial to closing this gap in care accessibility. In 2019, the University of British Columbia collaborated with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) to create the Essential Surgical Skills (ESS) program, launched at Aweil State Hospital, South Sudan, in order to increase local surgical capacity. Our objective was to evaluate the progress and surgical competencies of trainees enrolled in the ESS program. Methods: This is a mixed-method prospective cohort study evaluating trainee progress in the ESS program. Quantitative data include pre and post-training outputs (procedure logbooks, morbidity and mortality rates) and surgical proficiency (quizzes, Entrustable Professional Activities [EPAs]). Qualitative data include trainee semistructured interviews. Results: From May 2019 to December 2021, trainees performed 416 procedures. The most common procedures were skin grafting (15.6%), abscess drainage (13.1%) and reduction and splinting (12.3%). A total of 327 EPAs were completed, out of which 254 (77.6%) showed that the trainee could independently perform the procedure. Trainees have demonstrated full competency in the burn management and safe surgery modules. The pass rate for all quizzes was 100%. Surgical mortality rates recorded during the implementation of the ESS program remained unchanged from preimplementation rates (pretraining: 0.6%; during training: 0.1%; p = 0.0541). Surgical morbidity rates demonstrated a decline from 17% preimplementation to 12% postimplementation (p = 0.1767). Semistructured interviews indicated that trainees felt the program was empowering and key to their career development. Conclusion: Our study suggests that providing ESS training to general practitioners in under-resourced settings via a virtual platform is feasible.

G.; Hider, P.; Wilson, L.; Gruen, R. L.; Bickler, S. W.","BACKGROUND: Surgery is a foundational component of health-care systems. However, previous efforts to integrate surgical services into global health initiatives do not reflect the scope of surgical need and many health systems do not provide essential interventions. We estimate the minimum global volume of surgical need to address prevalent diseases in 21 epidemiological regions from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (GBD). METHODS: Prevalence data were obtained from GBD 2010 and organised into 119 disease states according to the WHO's Global Health Estimate (GHE). These data, representing 187 countries, were then apportioned into the 21 GBD epidemiological regions. Using previously defined values for the incident need for surgery for each of the 119 GHE disease states, we calculate minimum global need for surgery based on the prevalence of each condition in each region. FINDINGS: We estimate that at least 321·5 million surgical procedures would be needed to address the burden of disease for a global population of 6·9 billion in 2010. Minimum rates of surgical need vary across regions, ranging from 3383 operations per 100 000 in central Latin America to 6495 operations per 100 000 in western sub-Saharan Africa. Global surgical need also varied across subcategories of disease, ranging from 131 412 procedures for nutritional deficiencies to 45·8 million procedures for unintentional injuries. INTERPRETATION: The estimated need for surgical procedures worldwide is large and addresses a broad spectrum of disease states. Surgical need varies between regions of the world according to disease prevalence and many countries do not meet the basic needs of their populations. These estimates could be useful for policy makers, funders, and ministries of health as they consider how to incorporate surgical capacity into health systems.

Low and Middle-Income Countries bear a significant burden of paediatric burn injuries. In Ghana, limited data exists on the prevalence, characteristics and outcomes of paediatric burns. This study provides vital data on the local burden and epidemiology of paediatric burns at Ghana's main burns treatment center. The findings have significant value in informing prevention strategies, allocating resources, and improving quality of paediatric burn care. Study objective: To establish the prevalence and characteristics of paediatric burns injuries in Ghana's leading burn center. Methodology: A retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 662 adult and paediatric patients who presented with burns from all over Ghana between 2020 and 2022. The study encompassed medical records of paediatric burn cases (aged 0–14 years) admitted to the center from January 2020 to December 2022. A purposive sampling technique was used to select cases based on the inclusion criteria and elimination of cases with 20 % missing data. A total of 335 paediatric records were reviewed. Data analytical methods: Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies, mean, percentages were used to establish period prevalence and demographic characteristics of paediatric burns. Chi-square analysis and univariate logistic regression was utilized to explore associations between categorical variables, and predictors of burn outcome. Results: The period prevalence of paediatric burns was found to be 50.6 %. Paediatric burn cases predominantly affected males (57.6 %). Majority of cases fell within the age range of 1 to 5 years (70.1 %). Hot water emerged as the leading cause (58.4 %), whiles superficial partial thickness burns (51.9 %) was the predominant type of burn. Most cases involved burns affecting less than 20 % Total Body Surface Area (59.0 %). Multi-part body injuries were common (87.2 %), with the lower limb being the most affected (25.36 %). The mortality rate was calculated to be 21.0 %. Higher TBSA was a significant predictor of mortality (p < 0.001).

These teams typically rely on a team of international surgeons and anaesthetists volunteering for only a few weeks which makes teamwork and communication challenging and may compromise patient safety because surgical complications in these settings are higher than elsewhere [2]. However, the incidence of anaesthesia adverse events on surgical missions is unknown. We report our experience of 851 anaesthetics in Madagascar with the NGO, Mercy Ships. Methods For 6 months (November 2014-May 2015) we collected data prospectively on anaesthetic adverse events and postoperative complications. Complications were defined based on the US Anesthesia Quality Institute data set and divided into intra-operative, postoperative care unit (PACU), ward and surgical complications. Results A total of 851 surgical cases were undertaken by 33 different anaesthetists from 12 different countries. Of these, 247 (29%) surgical cases were children under 14 years. There were a total of 36 anaesthesia or PACU adverse events in 19 patients. Details are shown in Table 1. Surgical case mix was: maxillofacial 38%; plastic/reconstructive 11%; obstetric fistula 10%; paediatric orthopaedic 6% and general 35%. There were 50 postoperative complications (11 return to hospital, 22 return to OR, and 17 surgical site infections [SSI]). Only one was associated with an anaesthesia adverse event. This was an 8 year old boy who experienced a SSI after a neck contracture release where there was a difficult airway and contamination of the neck wound occurred. Discussion The incidence of anaesthesia adverse events was comparable to published data from Western institutions [3]. Maxillofacial surgery is associated with a higher incidence of airway complications due to the 'shared airway' and airway complications are also more frequent in children anaesthetised by non-specialist paediatric anaesthetists. This is reflected in our data: 16/17 airway complications occurred either in children or in head and neck cases or both. The exception was a 55 year old man undergoing hernia repair who was noted to have regurgitation, but no problems postoperatively. In our organisation the presence of one permanent surgeon and anaesthetist; strict orientation and evaluation procedures; and written guidelines including use of the WHO surgical safety checklist are likely contributing factors to the good safety record.

Methods: We searched the literature for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reporting the characteristics of patients with diabetic foot in African countries, with a particular focus on ulcer prevalence, amputation rate, and mortality. Findings: Fifty-five full-text papers and ten abstracts were retrieved, reporting data from 19 African countries on 56,173 diabetic patients. According to the data collected, the overall prevalence of foot ulcers was 13% and increased over time, especially since 2001. Approximately 15% of patients with foot lesions underwent major amputation and 14.2% died during hospitalization. In patients with diabetic ulcers, insulin therapy was uncommon and neuropathy was the most common predisposing factor, but the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease correlated with amputation rates. Amputation and mortality decreased over time, probably as result of the implementation of screening programs in the last ten years. Mortality was directly related to previous amputation.

METHODS: The operative activity at University Teaching Hospital of Kigali was evaluated through an operative database. As a part of this larger study, patient characteristics and outcomes were measured to determine areas for improvement in patient care. Data were collected on patient demographics, surgeon, diagnosis, and operation over a 12-month period. The primary outcome was POMR. Secondary outcomes were timing and hospital location of death. RESULTS: The POMR was 6 %. POMR in patients under 5 years of age was 10 %, 3 % in patients 5-14 years and 6 % in patients age >14 years. For emergency and elective operations, POMR was 9 and 2 %, respectively.

Design Cross-sectional study of all patients operated by surgical residents from October 2012 to September 2013. Setting University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali [CHUK]), a public, tertiary referral hospital in Kigali, Rwanda. Participants All patient data were entered into the operative database by surgical residents at CHUK. A total of 2833 cases were entered into the surgical database. Of them, 53 cases were excluded from further analysis because no surgical resident was listed as the primary or assistant surgeon, leaving 2780 cases for analysis. Results There were 2780 operations involving surgical residents. Of them, 51% of procedures were classified under general surgery, 38% orthopedics, 7% neurosurgery, and 4% urology. Emergency operations accounted for 64% of the procedures, with 56% of those being general surgery and 35% orthopedic. Further, 50% of all operations were trauma, with 71% of those orthopedic and 21% general surgery. Surgical faculty were involved in 45% of operations as either the primary or the assistant surgeons, while the remainder of operations did not involve surgical faculty. Residents were primary surgeons in 68% of procedures and assistant surgeons in 84% of procedures.

Generally, the desired outcomes from surgical management are healing, function, and aesthetics. We share our 8-year experience at Kapsowar Hospital in Kenya with the presentation, management, and outcome of human bites. We are uniquely situated to do so given the prevalence of human biting in our community and the full-time presence of a plastic surgeon at our institution. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to present human bite surgical management by a plastic surgeon certified by the American Board of Surgery working full-time on the African continent. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients who presented to the operating theater at Kapsowar Hospital with a human bite between 2013-2021. After identification of eligible patients, charts were reviewed assessing parameters including age, gender, timing from injury to presentation at hospital, localization of bite, severity of facial wounds using Lackmann's classification, surgical procedure(s), postoperative complications, surgical revisions, antibiotics administered, and circumstance of incident. Data were analyzed using SPSS 29.0.0.0. RESULTS: Forty-four patients were identified. Seventeen (38.6%) were female and 27 (61.4%) were male. Thirty-one patients had facial bites and 13 patients had bites to other parts of the body. Of facial bites, 70.3% resulted in amputation of the affected part while 29.7% were lacerations. Using Lackmann's classification for facial bite severity, IIIA bites (complete avulsion) were most common for both males (9) and females (7). Females comprised 68.4% of total lip bite victims. Bites to the extremity were associated with late presentation and infection. We report a salvage rate of 85.7% for infected digits. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with most other studies on human bites, our patient population presents with a higher rate of avulsive lip injuries, most commonly among women.

The effects of these demographic changes on the epidemiology of burn risk and thermal injury in Ethiopia are unknown. This gap constitutes a major barrier to the creation of effective burn prevention programs. METHODS: Yekatit 12 Hospital in Addis Ababa is the only burn unit in Ethiopia. In this cross sectional retrospective study, we identified and reviewed all admissions due to burn injury at that facility between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2016. We then compared them to a previously published burn cohort treated at the same facility between 7/1/2001 and 9/31/2002. Chi square was used to compare proportions between the two samples. Continuous covariates are reported as descriptive data due to missing variance data in the 2001-02 publication. RESULTS: There were a total of 121 subjects in the 2001-02 sample and 176 subjects in the 2016 sample. The 2016 sample was found to have a significantly larger proportion of males (57%) as compared to the 2001-02 sample (36%) (p=0.0003) and a significantly higher proportion of electrical injuries (27%) than the previous cohort (5%) (p<0.0001).

Thermal injury represents one of the most severe forms of trauma and is associated with remarkable morbidity and mortality. The predictors of burn mortality have been well described (age, % total body surface area burn [TBSA], and presence of inhalation injury). However, the contribution of the burn mechanism as a predictor of burn mortality is not well delineated. METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data, utilizing the Kamuzu Central Hospital (KCH) Burn Surveillance Registry from May 2011 to August 2019. Pediatric patients (≤12 years) with flame and scald burns were included in the study. Basic demographic variables including sex, age, time to presentation, %TBSA, surgical intervention, burn mechanism, and in-hospital mortality outcome was collected. Bivariate analysis comparing demographic, burn characteristics, surgical intervention, and patient outcomes were performed. Standardized estimates were adjusted using inverse-probability of treatment weights (IPTW) to account for confounding. Following weighting, logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the odds of in-hospital mortality based on burn mechanism. RESULTS: During the study period, 2364 patients presented to KCH for burns and included in the database with 1794 (75.9%) pediatric patients. Of these, 488 (27.6%) and 1280 (72.4%) were injured by flame and scald burns, respectively. Males were 47.2% (n = 230) and 59.2% (n = 755) of the flame and scald burn cohorts, respectively (p < 0.001.) Patients presenting with flame burns compared to scald burns were older (4. 7 ± 3.1 vs. 2.7 ± 2.3 years, p < 0.001) with greater %TBSA burns (17.8 [IQR 10-28] vs 12 [IQR 7-20], p < 0.001). Surgery was performed for 42.2% (n = 206) and 19.9% (n = 140) of the flame and scald burn cohorts, respectively (p < 0.001.) Flame burns had a 2.6x greater odds of in-hospital mortality compared to scald burns (p < 0.001) after controlling for sex, %TBSA, age, time to presentation, and surgical status. CONCLUSION: In this propensity-weighted analysis, we show that burn mechanism, specifically flame burns, resulted in a nearly 3-fold increase in odds of in-hospital mortality compared to scald burns. Our results emphasize flame and scald burns have major differences in the inflammatory response, metabolic profile over time, and outcomes.

Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by burn injury morbidity and mortality; African children have the highest burn mortality globally. In high-income countries, early surgical intervention has shown to improve survival. However, when applied to burn victims in LMICs, improved survival in the early excision cohort (≤5 d) was not seen. Therefore, we aimed to determine the magnitude of the effect of surgical intervention on burn injury survival. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected data, utilizing the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Database from May 2011 to July 2019, was performed. Pediatric patients (≤12 y) were included. Patients were excluded if they underwent surgical intervention for nonacute burn care management. Bivariate analyses stratifying by type of surgical intervention was performed, comparing demographics, burn characteristics, surgical intervention, and patient mortality. Standardized estimates were adjusted using the inverse-probability of treatment weights to account for confounding. Weighted logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the odds of mortality based on if a patient underwent surgical intervention. RESULTS: During the study, 2364 patients were seen at the Kamuzu Central Hospital, 1785 (75.5%) were children ≤12 y who met inclusion criteria. In the overall cohort, 342 (19.2%) underwent operations, including split-thickness skin graft (n = 196, 57.3%), debridement (n = 116, 33.9%), escharotomy (n = 19, 5.6%), and amputation (n = 1, 0.3%).

We, therefore, sought to assess the characteristics and predictors of in-hospital burn mortality in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: We performed a retrospective study of the prospectively collected Burn Injury Surveillance database from June 2011 to December 2019. We performed bivariate analysis and Poisson regression to assess risk factors for mortality in our infant burn population. RESULTS: 115 (7.3%) infants met inclusion criteria. The median age of 8 months (IQR: 6-10) and primarily male (n = 67, 58.8%). Most burns were from scald (n = 62, 53.9%). Infant burn mortality was 12.2%.

METHODS: Anonymized data for all procedures in the SmileTrain global database were analyzed by age, sex, country, region, and surgery type. DALYs averted were calculated using life expectancy tables and established and estimated disability weights. The cost-effectiveness analysis used mean SmileTrain procedural disbursement figures. Sensitivity analysis was performed using various cleft incidence rates, life expectancy tables, and disability weights. RESULTS: During 2003-2010 a total of 536,846 operations were performed on 364,467 patients-86 % in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific region. Procedure numbers increased yearly. Mean age at primary surgery-6.2 years (9.8 years in Africa)-remained fairly constant over time in each region.

To our knowledge, this retrospective case review and epidemiologic literature review is the first review of cleft care in Zimbabwe. Poverty in Zimbabwe, caused in part by the highest inflation rate in the world, has contributed to the emigration of a large number of specialists to other countries.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using the French surgical database OpEX (French Military Health Service) from January 2013 to August 2022. Patients operated on for an extremity injury less than one month old were included. RESULTS: During this period, 418 patients with a median age of 28 years [range 23-31 years] were included and totalized 525 extremity injuries. Among them, 190 (45.5%) sustained CRIs and 218 (54.5%) sustained NCRIs. Multiple upper extremity injuries and associated injuries were significantly more common in the CRIs group. The majority of NCRIs involved the hand. Debridement was the most common procedure in both groups. External fixation, primary amputation, debridement, delayed primary closure, vascular repair and fasciotomy were significantly predominant in the CRIs group. Internal fracture fixation and reduction under anaesthesia were statistically more frequent in the NCRIs group. The overall number of procedures and the overall number of surgical episodes were significantly higher in the CRIs group. CONCLUSION: CRIs were the most severe injuries and did not involve the upper and lower limbs separately. A sequential management was required with application of damage control orthopaedics followed by several procedures for reconstruction.

Identifying the prevalence of surgical disease at the community level is important for developing evidence-based pediatric surgical services and training. We hypothesize that the untreated surgical conditions in the pediatric population are largely uncharacterized and that such burden is significant and poorly understood. Furthermore, no such data exist at the population level to describe this population. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide cross-sectional cluster-based population survey to estimate the magnitude of surgical disease in Rwanda. Conducted as a verbal questionnaire, questions included representative congenital, acquired, malignant and injury-related conditions. Pediatric responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and univariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 1626 households (3175 individuals) were sampled with a 99% response rate; 51.1% of all individuals surveyed were younger than age 18. An estimated 50.5% of the total current surgical need occurs in children.

The intent was to assist in planning strategies for universal access to life-saving and disability-preventing surgical services. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: First-referral health facilities in the United Republic of Tanzania. Participants: 48 health facilities. Measures: The WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was employed to capture a health facility's capacity to perform basic surgical (including obstetrics and trauma) and anaesthesia interventions by investigating four categories of data: infrastructure, human resources, interventions available and equipment. The tool queried the availability of eight types of care providers, 35 surgical interventions and 67 items of equipment. Results: The 48 facilities surveyed served 18.6 million residents (46% of the population). Supplies for basic airway management were inconsistently available. Only 42% had consistent access to oxygen, and only six functioning pulse oximeters were located in all facilities surveyed. 37.5% of facilities reported both consistent running water and electricity.

Skin cancers are a major risk associated with albinism and are thought to be a major cause of death in African albinos. Challenges faced in the care of these patients need to be highlighted in order to develop a holistic management approach with a significant public health impact. The aim of the study was to determine the pattern of skin cancers seen in Albinos, and to highlight problems encountered in their management.Method: Case records of albinos managed in Imo state University teaching Hospital from June 2007 to May 2009 were reviewed. The data obtained was analyzed using descriptive statistics.Results and discussion: In the period under review, albinos accounted for 67% of patients managed for primary skin cancers. There were twenty patients with thirty eight (38) lesions. Sixty one percent of the patients were below 40 years. Average duration of symptoms at presentation was 26 months. The commonest reason for late presentation was the lack of funds. Squamous cell carcinoma was the commonest histologic variant. Most patients were unable to complete treatment due to lack of funds.Conclusion: Albinism appears to be the most important risk factor in the development of skin cancers in our environment.

In children and, particularly, in our environment where poverty, ignorance and disease are still high, they constitute significant morbidity and mortality. Previous studies on this topic in parts of Nigeria either lumped adults and children together or were retrospective. We, therefore, prospectively studied the current trends in burns in children. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This prospective study of burns spanned over a period of 18 months (June 2006-December 2007) at the Paediatric Surgery Units of the Imo State University Teaching Hospital, Orlu, and the Federal Medical Centre, Owerri, Imo State. Data were collected and analysed for age, sex, cause/type of burn, place of burn, presence or absence of adult/s, initial prehospital intervention, interval between injury and presentation, surface area and depth of burn and treatment and outcome. RESULTS: Fifty-three patients were studied, 31 (58.4%) were male and 22 (41.6%) were female (M:F = 1.4:1). Patients mostly affected were aged 2 years and below. The most common cause of burns was hot water in 31 (58.5%) patients. The vast majority of these injuries happened in a domestic environment (92.5%) and in the presence of competent adult/s (88.7%). Outcome of treatment was good: there were two (3.8%) deaths and 46 (86%) patients had complete recovery. CONCLUSION: Burns is still a major health problem among children in south eastern Nigeria. Fortunately, outcome of appropriate treatment is good. However, we think that poor safety consciousness among parents is a major predisposing factor.

N.; Shitsinzi, R.; Emarah, A.","BACKGROUND: Burns are the fourth most common type of trauma worldwide and a major cause of mortality and disability in developing countries. Although burns are common in Kenya, the mortality and morbidity patterns are yet to be well studied and documented comprehensively. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate burn clinical patterns, early outcomes and their associations among patients admitted with burn injuries at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH). METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted at MTRH between January 2016 and June 2017. A total of 189 patients admitted to the hospital with burns were recruited into the study. An interviewer-administered structured questionnaire and chart reviews were used to collect data on sociodemographic variables, burn clinical characteristics and early burn outcomes. Associations between patient characteristics and early burn outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Of the 182 burn patients whose data was analyzed, the median age was 2.4 years (IQR = 5.8) years and 149 (82%) were children below 18 years. Majority (76%) of burns were due to scalds. The commonest burn locations were the trunk and upper limbs (56%). Only 40% of patients received prehospital intervention. The median Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA) was 14.5% and 74% of the patients had 2nd degree burns. The median length of hospital stay was 16 days (IQR = 28) and commonest complication was wound infection. Proportion of deaths due to burns accounted for 9.3% of the patients. A TBSA of 20%-30% (p = 0.01) was associated with presence of burn complications while a TBSA of >10% (p = 0.03) and time from burn to admission (p = 0.03) were associated with the length of hospital stay. CONCLUSIONS: In our study, death was likely to occur in one in ten patients admitted with burns and TBSA was a predictor of presence of burn complications and length of hospital stay. There is a need for continued health education of the public on fire safety within the home environment for children and other vulnerable persons.

E.; Card, E. B.; Shirima, O.; Premkumar, A.; Massawe, H.; Sheth, N. P.","BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal injury contributes significantly to the burden of disease in Tanzania and other LMICs. For hospitals to cope financially with this burden, they often mandate that patients pay their entire hospital bill before leaving the hospital. This creates a phenomenon of patients who remain hospitalized solely due to financial hardship. This study aims to characterize the impact of this policy on patients and hospital systems in resource-limited settings. METHODS: A mixed-methods study using retrospective medical record review and semi-structured interviews was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Moshi, Tanzania. Information regarding patient demographics, injury type, days spent in the ward after medical clearance for discharge, and hospital invoices were collected and analyzed for orthopaedic patients treated from November 2016 to June 2017. RESULTS: 346 of the 867 orthopaedic patients (39.9%) treated during this time period were found to have spent additional days in the hospital due to their inability to pay their hospital bill. Of these patients, 72 patient charts were analyzed. These 72 patients spent an average of 9 additional days in the hospital due to financial hardship (range: 1-64 days; interquartile range: 2-10.5 days). They spent an average of 112,958 Tanzanian Shillings (TSH) to pay for services received following medical clearance for discharge, representing 12.3% of the average total bill (916,840 TSH). 646 hospital bed-days were spent on these 72 patients when they no longer clinically required hospitalization. 7 (9.7%) patients eloped from the hospital without paying and 24 (33.3%) received financial assistance from the hospital's social welfare office. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients do not have the financial capacity to pay hospital fees prior to discharge. This reality has added significantly to these patients' overall financial hardship and has taken hundreds of bed-days from other critically ill patients.

As patterns of injury in the pediatric population may differ from those in adults, risks specific to children in LMICs need to be identified for effective injury prevention and treatment. This study explores patterns of pediatric injury epidemiology and cost in Yaoundé, Cameroon to inform injury prevention and resource allocation. METHODS: Pediatric (age < 20 years) trauma patient data were collected at the emergency department (ED) of Central Hospital of Yaoundé (CHY) from April through October 2009. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were used to explore injury patterns and relationships between variables. Regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of receiving surgical care. RESULTS: Children comprised 19% (544) of trauma cases. About 54% suffered road traffic injuries (RTIs), which mostly affected the limbs and pelvis (37.3%). Half the RTI victims were pedestrians. Transportation to CHY was primarily by taxi or bus (69.4%) and a preponderance (71.1%) of the severely and profoundly injured patients used this method of transport. Major or minor surgical intervention was necessary for 17.9% and 20.8% of patients, respectively. Patients with an estimated injury severity score ≥ 9 (33.2%) were more likely to need surgery (p < 0.01). The median ED cost of pediatric trauma care was USD12.71 [IQR 12.71, 23.30]. CONCLUSIONS: Injury is an important child health problem that requires adequate attention and funding.

L.","Background Trauma remains a leading cause of death worldwide. The development of trauma systems in low-resource settings may be of benefit. The objective of this study was to describe operative procedures performed for trauma at a tertiary care facility in Kigali, Rwanda, and to evaluate geographical variations and referral patterns of trauma care. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all prospectively collected operative cases performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda, the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), between June 1 and Dec. 1, 2011, for injury-related diagnoses. We used the Pearson (2) and Fisher exact tests to compare cases arising from within Kigali to those transferred from other provinces. Geospatial analyses were also performed to further elucidate transfer patterns. Results Over the 6-month study period, 2758 surgical interventions were performed at the CHUK. Of these, 653 (23.7%) were for trauma. Most patients resided outside of Kigali city, with 337 (58.0%) patients transferred from other provinces and 244 (42.0%) from within Kigali. Most trauma procedures were orthopedic (489 [84.2%]), although general surgery procedures represented a higher proportion of trauma surgeries in patients from other provinces than in patients from within Kigali (28 of 337 [8.3%] v. 10 of 244 [4.1%]). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight geographical variations in access to trauma care in a low-income country and the first description of trauma procedures at a referral centre in Rwanda. Future efforts should focus on maturing prehospital and interfacility transport systems, strengthening district hospitals and further supporting referral institutions. Contexte Les traumatismes demeurent l'une des principales causes de deces dans le monde. La mise au point de systemes de traumatologie dans des milieux defavorises pourrait toutefois contribuer a ameliorer la situation. Notre etude avait pour objectif de decrire les interventions chirurgicales pratiquees sur les victimes de traumatismes dans un etablissement de soins tertiaires de Kigali, au Rwanda, et d'evaluer les variations geographiques et les habitudes d'orientation des patients dans le domaine de la traumatologie. Methodes Nous avons evalue retroactivement les donnees recueillies de facon prospective sur l'ensemble des interventions realisees au plus grand centre hospitalier regional du Rwanda, le Centre hospitalier universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), du 1(er) juin au 1(er) decembre 2011 pour les diagnostics lies a des blessures. Nous avons eu recours au test (2) de Pearson et au test exact de Fisher pour comparer les cas issus de la province de Kigali a ceux provenant d'autres provinces. Nous avons en outre effectue des analyses geospatiales afin de mieux comprendre les habitudes d'orientation des patients. Resultats Au cours des 6 mois de l'etude, 2758 interventions chirurgicales ont ete pratiquees au CHUK, dont 653 (23,7 %) pour des traumatismes. La majorite des patients residaient a l'exterieur de la capitale : 337 (58,0 %) d'entre eux avaient ete transferes d'autres provinces, et 244 (42,0 %), d'ailleurs dans la province. Si la plupart des interventions chirurgicales etaient orthopediques (489, soit 84,2 %), les patients d'autres provinces ont plus souvent subi des interventions generales que leurs compatriotes de la province de Kigali (28 sur 337, soit 8,3 %, par rapport a 10 sur 244, soit 4,1 %). Conclusion notre connaissance, il s'agit de la premiere etude mettant en lumiere les variations geographiques de l'acces aux soins en traumatologie dans un pays a faible revenu et de la premiere description des interventions chirurgicales pratiquees sur des victimes de traumatismes dans un centre regional du Rwanda.

In Rwanda, the burn unit at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK) is the only dedicated burn unit in the country and admits patients of all ages referred from the other provinces. However, since there are no official referral guidelines, it is unknown whether patients with burns are appropriately referred. This study aims to analyze referral patterns among burn patients admitted at the CHUK burn unit and their adherence to the referral criteria listed by the American Burn Association (ABA), comparing patients transferred to the burn unit from facilities within Kigali and those referred from facilities outside Kigali. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with acute burns admitted to the CHUK burn unit with data available on the province of origin from 2005 to 2019. Patients with burns younger than 16 y were defined as pediatric burns, as per the CHUK routines. Characteristics of all burns referred from a facility within Kigali (Pat-K) and facilities outside Kigali (Pat-O) were compared using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. The adherence to ABA referral criteria was assessed for variables with available data, which were total burnt surface area %, burn thickness, cause of burn, and age. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1093 patients, of which 1064 had data regarding if they were referred from other facilities to CHUK. Overall, the median age was 3 y (2-16 y), with Pat-O being older than Pat-K (P < 0.001). Scalds were the dominant cause of injury in both groups; flame was more common among Pat-O than among Pat-K (in 25.5% versus 10.6%, P < 0.01). Burns of larger size and depth were more common among Pat-O, as compared to the Pat-K group [median total burnt surface area % = 19% versus 15.5%, respectively (P < 0.001); presence of full-thickness burns = 55.6% versus 29.7 %, respectively (P < 0.001)]. Hospitalization was longer and in-hospital mortality higher in Pat-O than in Pat-K [LOS = 42 d (interquartile range 11-164) versus 28 d (interquartile range 9-132), P < 0.05; in-hospital mortality = 18.9% versus 10.1%, P < 0.001]. Among Pat-O, 85% had characteristics that mirrored one or more of the analyzed ABA criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no clear guidelines, referral patterns indicate that patients are being appropriately referred for specialized burn care in Rwanda. Compared to patients from Kigali, rural patients had larger and more severe injuries, needed more surgical interventions, and had worse outcomes. Most of referred patients matched criteria listed among international referral guidelines. However, the statement of national referral criteria is essential to improve timely access to adequate care.",2022,NA,J Surg Res,278,NA,216-222,35636196,10.1016/j.jss.2022.04.066,13914,Nezerwa 2022,NA,Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care; Burns,"Access & Barriers, Burns","Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Burns, Trauma",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Burns,Yes,No,No,No,No,No

The reported prevalence and pattern of such associated malformations, however, vary among studies. OBJECTIVES: To assess the frequencies and aetiologies of congenital malformations and associated medical conditions in children with orofacial clefts in Burkina Faso (Western Africa). METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was carried out at the El Fateh-Suka Clinic in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. All children who attended surgery for the repair of a cleft lip and/or palate were included in this study. RESULTS: The frequency of congenital malformations associated with cleft lip and/or palate was 39/185 (21.1%). In the group with multiple congenital malformations of unknown origin (34 patients; 18.4%), 66.7% had cleft lip and palate, followed by isolated cleft lip (27.4%) and isolated cleft palate (5.9%). The digestive system (35.3%), the musculoskeletal system (19.6%), and eye, ear, face, and neck (15.7%) were the most affected systems. In the group of syndromic malformations (five patients; 2.7%), amniotic band syndrome (one patient), Van der Woode syndrome (one patient), Goltz syndrome (one patient), and holoprosencephaly (two patients) were identified. Medical conditions included anaemia (39.4%), infections (9.2%), malnutrition (7.5%), and haemoglobinopathies (4.3%).

G.; Bakanisi, B.; Motsumi, J.; Azzie, G.","BACKGROUND: The global burden of surgical disease and severe shortage of trained surgeons around the world are now widely recognized. The greatest challenge in improving access to surgical care lies in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of surgeons per population is lowest. One part of the solution may be to create programs to train surgeons locally. We present our experience with an approach to designing a contextually appropriate surgical curriculum in Botswana. METHODS: Surgical logbooks from the largest tertiary care center in Botswana, dating from 2004 through 2010, were analyzed to yield total case numbers within clearly defined categories. Case numbers and local surgical opinion were combined to design a contextually relevant curriculum, with the Surgical Council on Resident Education curriculum as a template. RESULTS: Logbook analysis revealed that general surgeons in Botswana manage burns and perform a large number of skin grafts and extremity amputations. However, they perform few colonoscopies and complex laparoscopic procedures. The new curriculum included greater emphasis on surgical subspecialty procedures and surgical management of locally relevant conditions, such as the complications of infectious diseases.

Developing countries with sub-Saharan and Asian populations are affected more. Its mortality and non-fatal complications depend on several factors including age, sex, residency, cause, the extent of the burn, and time and level of care given. Objective: The purpose of this study was to assess the outcome of burn injury and its associated factor among patients who visited Addis Ababa burn emergency and trauma hospital. Methods: The institutional-based, retrospective cross-sectional study design was conducted from April 1, 2019, to March 30, 2021. After checking the data for its consistency the data were entered and analyzed by using SPSS version 25. A total of 241 patients who had visited Addis Ababa burn, emergency and trauma Hospitals after sustained burn injury were recruited through convenience sampling method for final analysis. Model goodness-of-fit was checked by Hosmer and Lemeshow test (0.272). After checking multi-collinearity both the bi-variable and multivariable logistic regression model was fitted and variables having a p-value less than or equal to 0.05 at 95% CI in the multivariable analysis were considered statistically significant. Result: Adults (age 15 to 60 years) are the most affected groups accounting for 55.2% followed by pediatric age groups (age <15 years) (43.6%) and the elderly (age > 60 years) (1.2%). Scald burn was the major cause accounting for 39 % followed by Flame burn (33.6%), Electrical burn (26.6%), and chemical burn (0.8%). The mean TBSA% was 15.49%, ranging from1% to 64%. Adult males are more affected by electrical burns while adult females and the elderly encounter flame burn. 78.4% of patients were discharged without complications, 14.9% were discharged with complications and 6.6% died. The commonest long-term complication is the amputation of the extremity (19, 7.9%). Age greater than 60 years and TBSA% greater than 30% is a strong predictors of mortality with odds of 2.2 at 95% CI of [1.32, 3.69] and 8.7 at 95% CI of [1.33, 57.32] respectively. Conclusion and recommendation: The mortality rate show decrement from previous studies.

METHODS: This scoping review was conducted on four databases (SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE) from inception through September 1, 2020 following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 3852 articles, of which 31 were included that examined the burden of PRS-related conditions in Malawi. Of these 31 articles, 25 primarily discussed burn-related care. Burns injuries have a high mortality rate; between 27 and 75% in the studies. The literature revealed that there are only two burn units nationally with one PRS specialist in each unit, compounded by a lack of interest in PRS specialization by Malawian medical students. Congenital anomalies were the only other PRS-related condition examined and reported in the literature, accounting for 23% of all pediatric surgeries in tertiary facilities. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to increase the country's capacity to handle burn reconstruction and other PRS-related conditions to reduce overall morbidity and mortality.

",Economic and Social Costs of Noma: Design and Application of an Estimation Model to Niger and Burkina Faso,"Mpinga, E. K.; Srour, M. L.; Moussa, M. A.; Dupuis, M.; Kagoné, M.; Grema, M. S. M.; Zacharie, N. B.; Baratti-Mayer, D.","BACKGROUND: While noma affects hundreds of thousands of children every year, taking their lives, disfiguring them and leaving them permanently disabled, the economic and social costs of the disease have not been previously estimated. An understanding of the nature and levels of these costs is much needed to formulate and implement strategies for the prevention and control of this disease, or to mitigate its burden. The objectives of our study were to develop a model for estimating the economic and social costs of noma and to provide estimates by applying this model to the specific contexts of two countries in the ""noma belt"", namely Burkina Faso and Niger. METHODS: Three main approaches were used. The estimation of prevalence levels of potential noma cases and of cases that should receive and actually do receive medical care was carried out using a literature review. The documentary approach made it possible to estimate the direct costs of noma by analyzing the database of a non-governmental organization operating in this field and present in both countries. Indirect costs were estimated using the human capital method and the cost component analysis technique. RESULTS: The direct costs of care and management of noma survivors amount to approximately USD 30 million per year in Burkina Faso, compared to approximately USD 31 million in Niger. They mainly include costs for medical treatment, surgery, hospital stays, physiological care, psychological care, social assistance, schooling, vocational training and care abroad. Indirect costs are estimated at around 20 million in lost production costs in Burkina and around 16 million in Niger. Costs related to premature deaths are estimated at more than USD 3.5 billion in Burkina Faso and USD 3 billion in Niger. Finally, the costs to survivors who are unable to marry are around USD 13.4 million in Burkina and around USD 15 million in Niger. Intangible costs were not calculated. CONCLUSIONS: The neglect of noma and inaction in terms of prevention and control of the disease have enormous economic and social costs for households, communities and states. Future studies of this kind are necessary and useful to raise awareness and eradicate this disease, which impacts the health and well-being of children and results in lifelong suffering and severe economic and social costs to survivors and their families.",2022,NA,Trop Med Infect Dis,7,7,NA,35878131,10.3390/tropicalmed7070119,15072,Mpinga 2022,NA,Cost; Noma,"Access & Barriers, Infectious & Chronic Conditions","Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Systematic Review",Yes,Yes,No,No,No,Yes,Infectious Conditions,No,No,No,Yes,No,No

""These data indicate that the main barrier to utilization of formal health care services that needs to be confronted is financial, and they also point to the need to examine ways to strengthen services for injured patients at both PHC clinics and at district hospitals. For both levels there is a need to develop an `essential services' approach within the broader context of the development of `essential surgery services'. This approach should address the training of general practitioners who staff district hospitals. Many of the surgical skills that are emphasized in the development of essential obstetric services are applicable to general surgery and to injury treatment as well. Similar considerations need to be applied to the development of essential training and supplies for injury treatment in the PHC clinics as such clinics served as the only site of treatment for more than one third of all severely injured persons in this study""",NA,NA,NA,Utilization of district health services by injured persons in a rural area of Ghana,"Mock, C.; Ofosu, A.; Gish, O.","Introduction: Injury is a significant health problem in many less developed countries. However, strategies for dealing with it have been only minimally addressed. Goals: We ought to assess the pattern of health care utilization by injured persons in rural Ghana. We thus hoped to provide data that would assist in strengthening injury treatment in this setting. Methods: Using household interviews, we surveyed 9442 person. We sought information on any injury during the previous year that resulted in one or more days of disability. Injured persons were interviewed regarding the mechanism of injury, treatment obtained and length of disability. Results: During the previous year, 923 nonfatal injuries were reported. Half the injured per sons (49%) received no formal medical care. When treatment was received, it was primarily delivered by a non-doctor staffed primary health care (PHC) clinic. Such clinics provided treatment for 30% of all injured persons (58% of those receiving formal medical care). Twenty percent of the injured received hospital-based care (39% of those receiving formal medical care). Among those using hospitals, the majority (92%) used district hospitals. Conclusions: In this setting, efforts to improve injury treatment should include district hospitals and PHC clinics. At both there is a need to advance the concept of 'essential' injury treatment services, addressing equipment, supplies and training. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",2001,NA,Int. J.

Some equipment, such as pulse oximetry and ventilators, were available in limited numbers and thus were not available to all who needed them on an emergency basis.
 Some nonreusable items, such as chest tubes, frequently ran out of stock. The problem was often not cost of repurchase, but difficulties and delays in the procurement process. Arterial blood gas determinations were possible at
some large hospitals. However, the cost of the test kept it from being used frequently. For example, repeat tests on the same patient on the same day
were rare. here were frequent, often long, periods of inoperability
of pieces of equipment while awaiting repairs. Especially problematic were computerized axial tomography
(CT) and image intensification (C arms).
 There were occasional periods of unavailability of laboratory tests when reagents ran out of stock. Sometimes, services (such as CT scanning) were
available but only to those who could pay, often in advance. This limited the availability of such services
on an emergency basis.
 No facility had capabilities for autotransfusion from
chest tubes.
 Prostheses for amputees were absent in almost all
locations. They were sometimes available in capital

Physical resources 
Each country or region should define trauma-related equipment and supplies that are ‘‘essential’’ at different levels of the health care system.

I.; Olorunfemi, G.; Olusanya, A.; Oluwatosin, O.","BACKGROUND: Cleft of the lip and palate is the most common craniofacial birth defect with a worldwide incidence of one in 700 live births. Early surgical repairs are aimed at improving appearance, speech, hearing, psychosocial development and avoiding impediments to social integration. Many interventions including the Smile Train partner model have been introduced to identify and perform prompt surgical procedures for the affected babies. However, little is known about the trends of the incidence and surgical procedures performed at our hospital. Nothing is also known about the relationship between the clinical characteristics of the patients and the timing of primary repairs. OBJECTIVE: To determine the trends in cleft surgeries, patterns of cleft surgeries and identify factors related to late primary repair at the University College Hospital, UCH, Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study and trends analysis of babies managed for cleft lip and palate from January 2007 to January 2019 at the UCH, Ibadan was conducted. The demographic and clinical characteristics were extracted from the Smile Train enabled cleft database of the hospital. The annual trends in rate of cleft surgeries (number of cleft surgeries per 100,000 live births) was represented graphically. Chi square test, Student's t-test and Mann Whitney U were utilised to assess the association between categorical and continuous variables and delay in cleft surgery (≥12 months for lip repair, ≥18months for palatal repair). Kaplan-Meier graphs with log-rank test was used to examine the association between sociodemographic variables and the outcome (late surgery). Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression was conducted to obtain the hazard or predictors of delayed cleft lip surgery. Stata version 17 (Statacorp, USA) statistical software was utilised for analysis. RESULTS: There were 314 cleft surgeries performed over the thirteen-year period of study. The male to female ratio was 1.2:1. The mean age of the patients was 58.08 ± 99.65 months. The median age and weight of the patients were 11 (IQR:5-65) months and 8 (IQR: 5.5-16) kg respectively. Over half (n = 184, 58.6%) of the cleft surgeries were for primary repairs of the lip and a third (n = 94, 29.9%) were surgeries for primary repairs of the palate. Millard's rotation advancement flap was the commonest lip repair technique with Fishers repair introduced within two years into the end of the study. Bardachs two flap palatoplasty has replaced Von Langenbeck palatoplasty as the commonest method of palatal repair. The prevalence of late primary cleft lip repair was about a third of the patients having primary cleft lip surgery while the prevalence of late palatal repair was more than two thirds of those who received primary palatoplasty. Compared with children who had bilateral cleft lip, children with unilateral cleft lip had a significantly increased risk of late primary repair (Adj HR: 22.4, 955 CI: 2.59-193.70, P-value = 0.005). CONCLUSION: There has been a change from Von Langenbeck palatoplasty to Bardachs two-flap palatoplasty. Intra-velar veloplasty and Fisher's method of lip repair were introduced in later years. There was a higher risk of late primary repair in children with unilateral cleft lip.",2023,NA,PLoS One,18,1,e0274657,36595514,10.1371/journal.pone.0274657,14303,Michael 2023,NA,Burden; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations,"Burden & Outcome, Congenital Malformations","Burden & Outcome, Congenital Malformations",Yes,No,No,No,Yes,No,Congenital Malformations,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

This ongoing study sought to determine the quality of life(QOL) of the patient with a cleft lip or palate scheduled for surgery. Methods/Description: This was an analytic cross-sectional study of the quality of life of 34 patients (aged 8-29 years) planned for cleft lip or palate repair that were recruited from six participating tertiary hospitals. Sociodemographic, clinical, and QOL measures were obtained before the scheduled surgery. The Cleft Questionnaire (Cleft Q) was adapted for measurement of the quality of life and the raw scores were Rasch transformed. Data was analysed using Stata version 17.0 (Stata Corp, Texas, USA) statistical software. Derived QOL scores were compared with established normative values. Relationships between independent variables and primary outcome measures were analyzed using Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test and one-way analysis of variance.

K.; Mock, C.; Quansah, R.; Donkor, P.; Stewart, B.","BACKGROUND: Ghana has a large and growing burden of injury morbidity and mortality. There is a substantial unmet need for trauma surgery, highlighting a need to understand gaps in care. METHODS: We conducted 8 in-depth interviews with trauma care providers (surgeons, nurses, and specialists) at a large teaching hospital to understand factors that contribute to and reduce delays in the provision of adequate trauma care for severely injured patients. The study aimed to understand whether providers thought factors differed between patients that were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and those that were not. Findings were presented for the third delay (provision of appropriate care) in the Three Delays Framework. RESULTS: Key findings included that most factors contributing delays in the provision of adequate care were related to the costs of care, including for diagnostics, medications, and treatment for patients with and without NHIS subscription. Other notable factors included conflicts between providers, resource constraints, and poor coordination of care at the facility. Factors which reduce delays included advocacy by providers and informal processes for prioritizing critical injuries. CONCLUSION: We recommend facility-level changes including increasing equity in access to trauma and elective surgery through targeted system strengthening efforts (e.g., a scheduled back-up call system for surgeons, anesthetists, other specialists, and nurses; designated operating theatres and staff for emergencies; training of staff), policy changes to simplify the insurance renewal and subscription processes, and future research on the costs and benefits of including diagnostics, medications, and common trauma services into the NHIS benefits package.",2022,NA,World J Surg,46,11,2607-2615,35994075,10.1007/s00268-022-06686-8,14139,Mesic 2022,"Sabina Rodriguez (2025-01-30 09:26:24)(Select): Qualitative study on the identified delays by staff of hospital (surgeons, nurses...)

In an effort to improve trauma care in Rwanda, the Ministry of Health developed a prehospital service, Service d'Aide Médicale Urgente (SAMU), and established an emergency medicine training program. However, little is known about patients receiving prehospital and emergency trauma care or their outcomes. The objective was to develop a linked prehospital-hospital database to evaluate patient characteristics, mechanisms of injury, prehospital and hospital resource use, and outcomes among injured patients receiving acute care in Kigali, Rwanda. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted at University Teaching Hospital - Kigali, the primary trauma centre in Rwanda. Data was included on all injured patients transported by SAMU from December 2012 to February 2015. SAMU's prehospital database was linked to hospital records and data were collected using standardised protocols by trained abstractors. Demographic information, injury characteristics, acute care, hospital course and outcomes were included. RESULTS: 1668 patients were transported for traumatic injury during the study period. The majority (77.7%) of patients were male. The median age was 30 years. Motor vehicle collisions accounted for 75.0% of encounters of which 61.4% involved motorcycles. 48.8% of patients sustained injuries in two or more anatomical regions. 40.1% of patients were admitted to the hospital and 78.1% required surgery.

This study aims to analyze worldwide provider-perceived barriers to the surgical repair of CLP in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: From 2011 to 2014, Smile Train distributed a multiple-choice, voluntary survey to healthcare providers to identify areas of need in CLP care worldwide. Data on provider-reported barriers to care were aggregated by year, country, and larger world regions. RESULTS: A total of 1997 surveys were completed by surgeons and healthcare providers (60.7% response rate). The most commonly reported barriers were ""patient travel costs"" (60.7%), ""lack of patient awareness"" (54.1%), and ""lack of financial support"" (52.8%). ""Patient travel costs"" was the most commonly reported barrier in sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, and South and Southeast Asia. ""Lack of financial support"" was the most commonly reported barrier in the Americas, Eastern Europe, and East Asia. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest intercontinental study on healthcare provider-identified barriers to care, representing the limitations experienced by healthcare professionals in providing corrective surgery for CLP around the world. Financial risk protection from hidden costs, such as patient travel costs, is essential.

The frequency and pattern of orofacial clefts in different parts of the world and among different human groups varies widely. Generally, populations of Asian or Native American origin have the highest prevalence, while Caucasian populations show intermediate prevalence and African populations the lowest. To date, little is known regarding the epidemiology and pattern of orofacial clefts in Tanzania. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study was conducted at Bugando Medical Centre to identify all children with orofacial clefts that attended or were treated during a period of five years. Cleft lip and/or palate records were obtained from patient files in the Hospital's Departments of Surgery, Paediatrics and medical records. Age at presentation, sex, region of origin, type and laterality of the cleft were recorded. In addition, presence of associated congenital anomalies or syndromes was recorded. RESULTS: A total of 240 orofacial cleft cases were seen during this period. Isolated cleft lip was the most common cleft type followed closely by cleft lip and palate (CLP). This is a departure from the pattern of clefting reported for Caucasian and Asian populations, where CLP or isolated cleft palate is the most common type. The distribution of clefts by side showed a statistically significant preponderance of the left side (43.7%) (χ2 = 92.4, p < 0.001), followed by the right (28.8%) and bilateral sides (18.3%). Patients with isolated cleft palate presented at very early age (mean age 1.00 years, SE 0.56). Associated congenital anomalies were observed in 2.8% of all patients with orofacial clefts, and included neural tube defects, Talipes and persistent ductus arteriosus.

L.","IMPORTANCE: In low- and middle-income countries, community-level surgical epidemiology is largely undefined. Accurate community-level surgical epidemiology is necessary for surgical health systems planning. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of surgical conditions in Burera District, Northern Province, Rwanda. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study with a 2-stage cluster sample design (at village and household level) was carried out in Burera District in March and May 2012. A team of surgeons randomly sampled 30 villages with probability proportionate to village population size, then sampled 23 households within each village. All available household members were examined. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The presence of 10 index surgical conditions (injuries/wounds, hernias/hydroceles, breast masses, neck masses, obstetric fistulas, undescended testes, hypospadias, hydrocephalus, cleft lip/palate, and clubfoot) was determined by physical examination. Prevalence was estimated overall and for each condition. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with surgical conditions, accounting for the complex survey design. RESULTS: Of the 2165 examined individuals, 1215 (56.2%) were female. The prevalence of any surgical condition among all examined individuals was 12% (95% CI, 9.2-14.9%). Half of conditions were hernias/hydroceles (49.6%), and 44% were injuries/wounds. In multivariable analysis, children 5 years or younger had twice the odds of having a surgical condition compared with married individuals 21 to 35 years of age (reference group) (odds ratio [OR], 2.2; 95% CI, 1.26-4.04; P = .01). The oldest group, people older than 50 years, also had twice the odds of having a surgical condition compared with the reference group (married, aged >50 years: OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.28-4.23; P = .01; unmarried, aged >50 years: OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.02-5.52; P = .06). Unmarried individuals 21 to 35 years of age and unmarried individuals aged 36 to 50 years had higher odds of a surgical condition compared with the reference group (aged 21-35 years: OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.74-3.82; P = .22; aged 36-50 years: OR, 3.35; 95% CI, 1.29-9.11; P = .02). There was no statistical difference in odds by sex, wealth, education, or travel time to the nearest hospital. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The prevalence of surgically treatable conditions in northern Rwanda was considerably higher than previously estimated modeling and surveys in comparable low- and middle-income countries.

The worldwide incidence is at 0.4 per 100,000. Mortality is up to 80% with no intervention, and 30-50% with intervention. Delay in intervention is associated with poor outcome. The risk factors for necrotizing fasciitis are diabetes mellitus, HIV, malignancy, illicit drug use, malnutrition among others.The aim of this study was to describe the clinical presentation and early outcomes of necrotizing fasciitis amongst Ugandan patients. METHODS: A prospective descriptive case series study conducted at Mulago National Referral and Teaching hospital from 5th January to 30th April 2011. Patients with necrotizing fasciitis were consecutively recruited after clinical evaluation, laboratory and microbiological tests were performed. Aggressive debridement was done and broad-spectrum antibiotics administered. Patients were followed up on surgical wards. Ethical approval was obtained. RESULTS: Thirty five patients were recruited over a 4 months period. More males were affected with, M: F 3:1. The 20-40 years age group was most affected. Attainment of healthy granulation tissue took 19 days on average. Mortality rate was 14% (5/35). Limbs were the most affected body parts 20/35 (57%), the scrotum and perineum (23%). Among infants the scalp was the most affected. Co-morbidities included HIV 8/35 (17%), and DM (5%) among others. The commonest organisms were gram negative.

The burden of surgical disease is greatest in Africa, where operations could save many lives. Previous facility-based studies have described operative procedure caseloads, but prospective studies investigating interventions, indications and perioperative mortality rates (POMR), are rare. Methods. A prospective, questionnaire-based collection of data on all major and minor operative procedures was undertaken at 2 hospitals in rural Uganda covering 4 and 3 months in 2011, respectively. Data included patient characteristics, indications for the interventions performed, and outcome after surgery. Results. We recorded 2,790 operative procedures on 2,701 patients. The rate of major operative procedures per 100,000 population per year was 225. Patients undergoing major operative procedures (n = 1,051) were mostly women (n = 923; 88%) because most interventions were performed owing to pregnancy-related complications (n = 747; 67%) or gynecologic conditions (n = 114; 10%). General operative interventions registered included herniorrhaphy (n = 103; 9%), exploratory laparotomy (n = 60; 5%), and appendectomy (n = 31; 3%). The POMR for major operative procedures was 1 % (n = 14) and was greatest after exploratory laparotomy (13%; n = 8) and caesarean delivery (1%; n = 4). Most deaths = 16) were a result of sepsis (n = 10-11) or hemorrhage (n = 3-5). Conclusion. The volume of surgery was low relative to the size of the catchment population. The POMR was high. Exploratory laparotomy and caesarean section were identified as high-risk procedures.

The strengthening of African initiatives to support African-led comprehensive cleft care will be both imperative and exciting to witness in the coming decades.

Efforts to improving CLP care in SSA have historically taken the form of short-term surgical interventions (STSIs), conventionally referred to as ‘mission’ trips. These short, service-based trips emphasize efficiency and surgical volume and arrive with large numbers of international staff. Successful STSIs share the expertise of visiting surgeons, provide educational opportunities for local surgeons, and foster long-term relationships over many years. Learning is bidirectional as visiting surgeons learn different systems of care and witness the surgical challenges of operating within a more resource-limited setting.

Traditional healers often predominate as the first line source of medical care, particularly in rural regions, and may be less likely to refer a child with CLP to a surgeon.

",Literacy,"Patient literacy rates vary widely within SSA, with half of caregivers in Nigeria having a secondary education.",NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"Awareness:
Cleft education should target both prospective parents as well as physicians, nurses, and community health workers. Initiatives should focus on capturing those caregivers with the highest potential for early CLP identification and referral, including hospital staff in maternity wards, midwives, community health workers, and specifically in SSA, traditional healers. Additionally, the rise of mobile phones and the expansion of internet access bring promise for more efficient information delivery, democratization of health education, and ultimately lower the barrier to surgical care. 

Financial barriers:
The focus should be shifted internally with the expansion of national health insurance to cover more aspects of comprehensive cleft care.

Geographic barriers:
Although the ultimate solution to reducing geographic barriers is a more robust rural health infrastructure, existing health resources can be maximized in the meantime through decentralization. Task sharing, whereby tasks are shared between different health workers. This endeavor can be further enhanced through telesurgery, whereby less experienced surgical teams can take on surgeries under the virtual supervision of specialists. Another example of decentralization is through active case-finding targeted toward remote regions.

Cleft Surgical Workforce:
Increasing local training opportunities and by improving the quality of existing training programs. International cleft NGOs (e.g. Operation Smile, Smile Train) fund training sessions for surgeons and other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team, relying on local or regional trainers. Lastly, there is an emerging role for technology in interdisciplinary, international cleft discussion forums and education. 

Fragmentation of Cleft Care:
Short-term surgical interventions should at a minimum include one cleft surgeon, anesthesia provider, and nurse from the country where the intervention is taking place. STSIs should consciously shift from an emphasis on surgical volume to that of skills transfer, with emphasis on integrating other members of a multidisciplinary cleft team who can provide training and education. Furthermore, initiatives geared towards raising community awareness of CLP should highlight the importance of long-term follow-up and multidisciplinary care in addition to timely surgical repair.",NA,NA,NA,Perspectives on the state of cleft lip and cleft palate patient care in Africa,"Liu, R.

A.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with cleft lip -palate (CLP) experience morbidity and social stigma, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as those of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Delays in treatment secondary either to lack of awareness, skills, equipment and consumables; poor health infrastructure, limited resources or a combination of them, has led to SSA having the highest rates of death and second highest rates of disability-adjusted life years in patients with CLP globally. Here we review current perspectives on the state of comprehensive cleft lip and palate repair in Africa. RECENT FINDINGS: To bridge gaps in government health services, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have emerged to provide care through short-term surgical interventions (STSIs). These groups can effect change through direct provision of care, whereas others strengthen internal system. However, sustainability is lacking as there continue to be barriers to achieving comprehensive and longitudinal cleft care in SSA, including a lack of awareness of CLP as a treatable condition, prohibitive costs, poor follow-up, and insufficient surgical infrastructure. With dedicated local champions, a comprehensive approach, and reliable partners, establishing sustainable CLP services is possible in countries with limited resources.

The concept of day-care surgery has been well established since the early nineties. Since then, enthusiasts have also indicated that day-care surgery represents a safe, cost-effective and efficient practice. Methods: A 3-year retrospective analysis of all day-care plastic surgical cases undertaken in the unit from January 2001 to December 2003 at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto. Folders of such patients were obtained from the hospital's medical records department. The information obtained was analyzed for demographic data, surgical problems, type of anaesthesia and postoperative complications. Results: A total of 148 procedures were carried out in 137 patients. This represented 37.2% of all procedures done and 36.5% of all patients treated within the same period in the unit. The ages ranged between 2 weeks and 58 years (mean = 23.1 years). There were 66 males and 71 females, giving a male: female ratio of 1:1.1. The most frequently performed procedure was lipomectomy (11.7%), followed by biopsy of skin tumours (10.9%), incision of tongue tie (10.2%), excision of breast lump (9.5%), reconstruction of facial structures (8.8%), ganglionectomy (8.0%) and others. The anaesthesia, used was loco-regional with lignocaine in 92(67.2%) patients, intravenous ketamine in 41(29.9%) patients and inhalation anaesthetics in the remaining 4 (2.9%). postoperative complications were observed in 13 (9.5%) patients, the commonest of which was wound infection (8.0%), followed by bleeding (5.1%), pain (5.1%) and haematoma (2.9%). Readmission rate was 3.6%, mainly due to bleeding and delayed recovery from anaesthesia. Neither significant wound disruption nor mortality was recorded.

H.","BACKGROUND: The burden of surgical disease in refugee and internally displaced person (IDP) populations has not been well defined. Populations fleeing conflict are mobile, limiting the effectiveness of traditional sampling methods. We employed novel sampling and survey techniques to conduct a population-based surgical needs assessment amongst IDPs in Kerenik, West Darfur, Sudan, over 4 weeks in 2008. METHODS: Satellite imagery was used to identify man-made structures. Ground teams were guided by GPS to randomly selected households. A newly created surgical needs survey was administered by surgeons to household members. One randomly selected individual answered demographic and medical history questions pertaining to themselves and first-degree blood relatives. All household members were offered a physical examination looking for surgical disease. FINDINGS: There were 780 study participants; 82% were IDPs. A history since displacement of surgical and potentially surgical conditions was reported in 38% of respondents and by 73% of respondents in first-degree blood relatives. Surgical histories included trauma (gunshots, stabbings, assaults) (5% respondents; 27% relatives), burns (6% respondents; 14% relatives), and obstetrical problems (5% female respondents; 11% relatives). 1485 individuals agreed to physical examinations. Untreated surgical and potentially surgical disease was identified in 25% of participants. INTERPRETATION: We identified and characterized a high burden of surgical and potentially surgical disease in an IDP population in West Darfur. Our study is unique in its direct assessment of a traumatized, mobile, vulnerable population. Health officials and agencies charged with the care of IDP and refugee populations should be aware of the high prevalence of surgical and potentially surgical conditions in these communities.

Yet, little is known about the emergency and essential surgical care (EESC) capacity of facilities in many African countries. The objective of this study was to assess the EESC capacity in different types of hospitals across Cameroon. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used the WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess EESC, investigating four key areas: infrastructure, human resources, interventions, and equipment and supplies. Twelve hospitals were surveyed between August and September 2009. Facilities were conveniently sampled based on proximity to road traffic and sociodemographic composition of population served in four regions of Cameroon. To complete the survey, investigators interviewed heads of facilities, medical advisors, and nursing officers and consulted hospital records and statistics at each facility. RESULTS: Seven district hospitals, two regional hospitals, two general hospitals, and one missionary hospital completed the survey. Infrastructure for EESC was generally inadequate with the largest gaps in availability of oxygen concentrator supply, an on-site blood bank, and pain relief management guidelines. Human resources were scarce with a combined total of six qualified surgeons, seven qualified obstetrician/gynecologists, and no anesthesiologists at district, regional, and missionary hospitals. Of 35 surgical interventions, 16 were provided by all hospitals. District hospitals reported referring patients for 22 interventions. Only nine of the 67 pieces of equipment were available at all hospitals for all patients all of the time.

The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of congenital anomalies in Cote d'Ivoire. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was a multicentric study of three academic hospitals and the Heart Institute of Abidjan over 10 years. The epidemiologic Data concerned the Parturients, the annual frequency of congenital abnormalities. Distribution of the congenital abnormalities according to the organs, overall mortality and lethality of congenital abnormalities were evaluated. RESULTS: Over 10 years, 1.632 newborns with 1.725 congenital anomalies were recorded. Frequency was 172.5 congenital anomalies per annum. Parturients were less than 35 years in 33% of cases, multigravida in 20%, multiparous in 18% and had a low socio economic status in 96% of cases.

The purpose of this study is to utilize a comprehensive database to describe the epidemiology of pediatric injuries at a tertiary hospital in Malawi. Methods: Data were prospectively collected on patients presenting to the emergency department for treatment of injuries from 2008 to 2010 (n = 23,625). The subset of pediatric patients (n = 7233) underwent cross-sectional analysis to examine demographics, injury environment, timing and mechanisms. Results: Pediatric patients, (0-16 years) comprised 30.6% of all trauma patients. Mean age was 7.2 years. Falls were the most common injury (43%), followed by burns (11.1%), pedestrian road traffic injuries (9.7%), foreign bodies (7.5%), and assaults (7.2%). Statistically significant differences in injury pattern were observed between gender, age groups and season. After logistic regression, predictors of fall included male gender, home setting, and rainy season, whereas predictors of burn included female gender, age 0-5 yrs, home setting, and cold season. Predictors of pedestrian injury included age 6-10 yrs, female, and roadside setting. Predictors of foreign body ingestion included age 0-5 yrs, female gender, home setting, and daytime, and predictors of assault include male gender, age 11-16 yrs, nighttime hours. All predictors were statistically significant (p < 0.05). Conclusions: This study revealed patterns of injury based upon age, gender, location, and season. Our results may prove useful to stakeholders in injury prevention for designing, evaluating, and implementing programs to improve public safety in children in Malawi and similar resource poor nations.

The aim of the study was to determine the period prevalence, pattern and perceptions of cleft lip and cleft palate in children born between 2005 and 2010 in two hospitals in Kisoro District, Uganda. METHODS: The study involved a retrospective review of medical records of mothers who delivered live babies between January 2005 and December 2010 in Kisoro Hospital and St. Francis Hospital, Mutolere in Kisoro District. Key informant interviews of mothers (n = 20) of the children with cleft lip and/or clip palate and selected medical staff (n = 24) of the two hospitals were carried out. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Over the 6 year period, 25,985 mothers delivered live babies in Kisoro Hospital (n = 13,199) and St. Francis Hospital, Mutolere (n = 12,786) with 20 babies having oro-facial clefts. The overall period prevalence of the clefts was 0.77/1,000 live births. Sixty percent (n = 12) of children had combined cleft lip and palate and the same proportion had clefts on the left side of the face. More boys were affected than girls: 13 versus 7. About 45% of mothers were hurt on realizing that they had delivered a child with an oro-facial cleft. Forty percent of mothers indicated that a child with oro-facial cleft was regarded as an outcast. About 91.7% (n = 22) of the medical staff reported that these children were not accepted in their communities. Surgical intervention and psychosocial support were the management modalities advocated for by most respondents. CONCLUSION/RECOMMENDATIONS: The period prevalence of combined cleft lip and palate in two hospitals in Kisoro District was comparable to some findings elsewhere. Cleft lip and cleft palate are a medical and psychosocial problem in Kisoro District that calls for sensitization and counseling of the families and communities of the affected children. The policy makers need to strategically plan for provision of rehabilitation with feeding obturators to facilitate easy feeding to gain weight before surgical intervention of the affected children.",2014,NA,BMC Oral Health,14,NA,104,25135242,10.1186/1472-6831-14-104,13655,Kesande 2014,NA,Burden; Cleft Palate,"Burden & Outcome, Congenital Malformations","Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Congenital Malformations,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

Most were children 0–5 years (41.7%, n=152), 34.5% (n=126) were 6–11 years, and 23.8% (n=87) were 12–17 years. The leading causes of pediatric injuries were falls (n=137, 37.5%) and road traffic injuries (n=125, 34.5%). The mortality rate was 8.2% (n=30). Of the in-hospital deaths, 43.3% were children with burn injuries who also had a higher odds of mortality than children with other injuries (OR 8.72, p<0.001). The factors associated with in-hospital mortality and morbidity were vital sign abnormalities, burn severity, abnormal Glasgow Coma Score, and ICU admission. Conclusion: The mortality rate of injured children in our cohort was high, especially in children with burn injuries. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality, interventions should be prioritized that focus on pediatric injured patients that present with abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, and severe burns.

M.; Nyavandu, K.; Machumu, B.; Kwiratuwe, S.; Rej, P. H.","An increase of congenital anomalies in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been reported. Congenital malformations (CMs) are not uncommon among newborns and, if left untreated, can contribute to increased neonate morbidity and mortality. Methods Medical records of all individuals admitted with a diagnosed CM to HEAL Africa Teaching Hospital (Goma, DRC) from 2002 to 2014 (n=1301) were reviewed. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics to summarize chart records, and inferential statistics to investigate significant barriers to earlier treatment. Results Since 2012, the number of patients treated each year for CMs has increased by over 200% compared to the average annual number of cases treated from 2002-2011. Though delayed presentation of patients to HEAL Hospital was very obvious, with an average age of 8.2 years. We find that patient age has been significantly decreasing (p=0.037) over time. The average distance separating patients from HEAL Hospital was 178 km, with approximately one third living 350 km or further from the treatment center. Distance is the most significant (p=3.33x10<sup>-6</sup> ) barrier to earlier treatment. When controlling for an interaction between gender and the use of mercy funds, we also find that female patients are at a significant (p=1.04x10<sup>-3</sup> ) disadvantage to undergo earlier corrective surgery. This disadvantage is further illustrated by our finding that 89% of women and girls, and over 81% of all patients, required mercy funds to cover the cost of surgery in 2014. Lastly, the mortality rate for surgery was low and averaged less than 1.0%. Conclusion Despite a formal end to the war in 2009, and an overall increase in individuals undergoing corrective surgery, distance, poverty, and gender are still massive barriers to CM care at HEAL Hospital, Goma, DRC. We find that patients have been successfully treated earlier by HEAL, although the average age of CM correction in 2014 (4.9 years) is still above average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, we advocate for further funding from the National Government and international health agencies to enable continued treatment of CMs in rural residents of the eastern DRC.

B.","BACKGROUND: There is a high prevalence of orofacial clefts in low- and middle-income countries with significant unmet need, despite having 50% of the population younger than 18 years in countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The purpose of this article is to report on the experience of general surgeons with orofacial clefts at a single institution. METHODS: This is a retrospective study of patients treated for cleft lip/palate in the province of North Kivu, DRC between 2008 and 2017. RESULTS: A total of 1112 procedures (122/year) were performed. All procedures were performed by general surgeons following training by an international nongovernmental aid organization. A total of 59.2% of patients were male and the median age was 3.4 years (interquartile range: 0.7-13 years). Average distance from surgical center to patient location was 242.6 km (range: 2-1375 km) with outreach performed for distances >200 kms. A majority (82.1%) of patients received general anesthesia (GA) with significant differences in use of GA, age, weight, and length of stay by major orofacial cleft category. Of the 1112 patients, 86.1% were reported to have cleft lip alone, 10.5% had cleft lip and palate, and 3.4% cleft palate alone. Despite this, only 5.3% of patients underwent surgical repair of cleft palate. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors including malnutrition, risk of bleeding, procedural complexity, and cosmetic results may contribute to the distribution of procedures performed where most cleft palates are not treated.

Investigations detailing met and unmet surgical access are necessary to inform appropriate resource allocation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Surgical volume, outcomes, and distribution of pediatric general surgical procedures were analyzed using prospective pediatric surgical databases from four separate regional hospitals in Uganda. The current averted burden of surgical disease through pediatric surgical delivery in Uganda and the unmet surgical need based on estimates from high-income country data was calculated. RESULTS: A total of 8514 patients were treated at the four hospitals over a 6-year period corresponding to 1350 pediatric surgical cases per year in Uganda or six surgical cases per 100,000 children per year. The majority of complex congenital anomalies and surgical oncology cases were performed at Mulago and Mbarara Hospitals, which have dedicated pediatric surgical teams (P < 0.0001). The averted burden of pediatric surgical disease was 27,000 disability adjusted life years per year, which resulted in an economic benefit of approximately 23 million USD per year. However, the average case volume performed at the four regional hospitals currently represents 1% of the total projected pediatric surgical need. CONCLUSIONS: This investigation is one of the first to demonstrate the distribution of pediatric surgical procedures at a country level through the use of a prospective locally created database. Significant disease burden was averted by local pediatric and adult surgical teams, demonstrating the economic benefit of pediatric surgical care delivery.

They mainly affect the elderly population. Pinch grafting (PG) could be used to treat a variety of CLUs. However, in Cameroon, there is scarce data on the outcome of PG of CLUs in elderly patients in rural hospitals where most of these patients seek for medical attention and where clinicians rely on unconventional wound dressing methods to treat CLUs. Our objective was to describe the outcome of PG of CLUs in elderly patients in rural Cameroon. Methods: This was a prospective study conducted in a rural hospital of North West Cameroon. From February 2015 to January 2016, comprehensive historical and clinical data were collected per elderly patient who presented with a chronic leg ulcer necessitating PG. PG was done using a simple procedure and each patient followed up for 8months. Outcome was described in terms of ulcer healing and pain and donor site complications. Results: Our series included 13 patients: 8 males (61.54%; 95% CI: 31.58-86.14) and 5 females (38.46%; 95% CI: 13.86-68.42) aged from 69 to 88years (mean: 77.54±5.70years). Three patients (23.08%; 95% CI: 5.04-53.81) had associated co-morbidities. All the ulcers were unilateral with durations ranging from 7 to 41months (mean: 19.46±11.03months). The ulcers ranged in size from 9.0 to 38.1cm2 (mean: 17.66±8.35cm 2). We registered one (7.69%; 95% CI: 0.19-36.03) graft rejection. Concerning the other ulcers, ten (83.33%; 95% CI: 51.59-97.91) had healed after 12 postoperative weeks while 2 (16.67%; 95% CI: 2.09%-48.41) had healed after 14 postoperative weeks and the mean healing time was 12.33±0.78weeks. Patients with healed ulcers had reduced ulcer site pain from the immediate postoperative period but there was no significant difference in the mean pain scores before and after graft (6.77 against 4.23, p=0.13). These ulcers remained healed after 8 postoperative months. Each donor site had healed 2weeks after PG. Donor site problems were minimal and included hypopigmentation.

Results Ghanaians face numerous barriers to accessing quality SOTA care, primarily due to health system inadequacies. Over 77% of surgical operations performed in Ghana are essential procedures, most of which are performed at district-level hospitals that do not have consistent access to imaging and operative room fundamentals. Tertiary facilities have consistent access to these modalities but lack consistent access to oxygen and/or oxygen concentrators on-site as well as surgical supplies and anaesthetic medicines. Ghanaian patients cover up to 91% of direct SOTA costs out-of-pocket, while health insurance only covers up to 14% of the costs. The Ghanaian surgical system also faces severe workforce inadequacies especially in district-level facilities. Most specialty surgeons are concentrated in urban areas. Ghana's health system lacks a solid information management foundation as it does not have centralized SOTA databases, leading to incomplete, poorly coded, and illegible patient information. Conclusion This review establishes that surgical services provided in Ghana are focused primarily on district-level facilities that lack adequate infrastructure and face workforce shortages, among other challenges. A comprehensive scale-up of Ghana's surgical infrastructure, workforce, national insurance plan, and information systems is warranted to improve Ghana's surgical system.",2022,NA,Glob.

We aimed to create a prospective trauma registry to expand the data elements collected on injury at a busy tertiary center in Yaoundé Cameroon. METHODS: Details of the injury context, presentation, care, cost, and disposition from the emergency department (ED) were gathered over a 6-month period, by trained research assistants using a structured questionnaire. Bivariate and multivariate models were built to explore variable relationships and outcomes. RESULTS: There were 2,855 injured patients in 6 months, comprising almost half of all ED visits. Mean age was 30 years; 73 % were male. Injury mechanism was road traffic injury in 59 %, fall in 7 %, penetrating trauma in 6 %, and animal bites in 4 %. Of these, 1,974 (69 %) were discharged home, 517 (18 %) taken to the operating room, and 14 (1 %) to the intensive care unit. The body areas most severely injured were pelvis and extremity in 43 %, head in 30 %, chest in 4 %, and abdomen in 3 %. The estimated injury severity score (eISS) was <9 in 60 %, 9-24 in 35 %, and >25 in 2 %. Mortality was 0.7 %. In the multivariate analysis, independent predictors of mortality were eISS ≥9 and Glasgow Coma Score ≤12. Road traffic injury was an independent predictor for the need to have surgery. Trauma registry results were presented to the Ministry of Health in Cameroon, prompting the formation of a National Injury Committee.

The exact prevalence is difficult to assess due to insufficient data, different study designs, and deferent study definitions of chronic wounds. There is limited data on the prevalence and the burden of chronic wound in our subregion. This study was therefore carried out to establish the burden of chronic wound in order to document a baseline data for monitoring progress, as well as provide information for advocacy on equitable distribution of resources for wound care. Method: This was a retrospective review between January 2007 and December 2022. Data was analysed using SPSS. Result: A total of 866 patients with new chronic wounds were seen at an average of 54 cases per year. An average of 330 old and new chronic wounds are seen yearly. Chronic ulcers are developing at a rate of 1.2/1000 population, and the prevalence of chronic ulcer is 3.3/1000 population. Most patients were males (57.2 %), with a mean age of 41.7years ± 20.6.

Management of chronic wounds based on evidence-based practice requires baseline data for adequate planning. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to determine the point prevalence of chronic wounds in a tertiary hospital (University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria) and utilize this information for subsequent wound care planning. METHODS: The study was carried out within a 1-month period and included all patients seen in the hospital with chronic wounds. The data obtained was entered into a designed form and was subsequently analyzed. RESULTS: There were 48 patients with 78 wounds representing approximately 11% of patients seen in the Department of Plastic, Reconstructive, and Aesthetic Surgery each month. Their ages ranged from 3 months to 80 years; the median age was 48 years. The male to female ratio was 1.6 to 1. The duration of the wounds ranged from 6 weeks to 780 weeks; the median duration of the wounds was 10 weeks. The area of the wounds ranged from 1 cm(2) -1,248 cm(2) (median 24 cm(2)). The most common chronic wounds were diabetic wounds, followed by pressure ulcers, postinfection ulcers, posttraumatic ulcers, burn wounds, malignant ulcers, and venous ulcers.

A.; Farhat, B.; Lalonde, D. H.; Owusu-Danso, O.; Agbenorku, P.; Hoyte-Williams, P. E.; Rockwell, W. B.","INTRODUCTION: Expanding surgical capacity is very difficult in resource-constrained countries. Financial input and additional physical operating room space are needed. The surgical patient volume exists, but the lack of operating room time causes postponement of cases. Hand surgery is particularly important as it improves patient function and allows for a timely return to the workforce after injury. Some hand surgery cases may be performed under local anesthesia with a very basic instrument set in a procedure room. This arrangement eliminates the need and financial burden of an equipped operating room and the need for an anesthesiologist. We hypothesized that performing hand surgery in a simple procedure room by a surgeon with knowledge of adequate local anesthesia could increase hand surgery capacity significantly in a low-income country. METHODS: This technique has been instituted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, with the use of a single procedure room that was previously used for storage. A surgeon trained in performing wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet technique visited Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and provided lectures about hand surgery under local anesthesia and evidence-based sterility for 6 years. The number and type of cases performed in the procedure room were recorded for the first 11 months after it opened in 2017. RESULTS: For 11 months, use of this room had increased surgical capacity by 33 cases per month. Patient ages ranged from 2 months to 65 years. There have been 358 total cases performed, 240 of which were hand cases. This included washout of hand wounds (n = 87), tendon repair (n = 54) including a single tendon transfer, fracture pinning (n = 33), amputations (n = 24), trigger finger repair (n = 10), nerve repair (n = 6), congenital hand surgery (n = 4), and other (n = 22). Cost savings per case in the procedure room ranges from 500 cedis (US $100) to 2000 cedis (US $400). CONCLUSIONS: The simple procedure room runs more efficiently and is less costly compared with the main operating rooms. Although the case volume has increased surgical capacity significantly, costs to the hospital and patient have decreased. The hospital is reimbursed in a timely fashion for the procedures directly by the patient using this technique. The creation of a single procedure room for wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet hand surgery has helped address the issues of inadequate operating room space, time, and expense in resource-constrained Ghana.",2020,NA,Ann Plast Surg,84,4,385-389,32118629,10.1097/sap.0000000000002196,14360,Holoyda 2020,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-20 23:36:05)(Select): Doctors were trained to carry out surgeries, which improved surgical capacity; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-20 23:35:16)(Select): Congenital conditions were managed with reconstructive surgery;",Access to Healthcare; Anesthesia; Barriers to Care; Surgical Capacity,Access & Barriers,"Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations, Trauma",Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Other,No,No,No,No,No,Yes

INTERVENTIONS AND METHODS: Surgical programmes for three congenital conditions were analysed: clefts (lip and palate); congenital heart anomalies; and neural tube defects. Data from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study were used to estimate the combination of fatal burden that could be addressed by surgical care and the additional long-term non-fatal burden associated with increased survival. RESULTS: Of the estimated 21.6 million DALYs caused by these three conditions in LMICs, 12.4 million DALYs (57%) are potentially addressable by surgical care among the population born with such conditions.

Methods: This is a pre-post cohort study, conducted in a referral hospital in Tanzania. Patients who underwent burn scar contracture release surgery in 2017-2018 were eligible. ROM (goniometry), disability (WHODAS 2.0) and QoL (EQ-5D) were assessed. The ROM data were compared to the ROM that is required to perform activities of daily living without compensation, i.e. functional ROM.

METHODS: The study was conducted in a rural Tanzanian hospital in 2017-2018. All patients admitted with burns were eligible. Complications were scored during admission as an indication for safety. Survivors of severe burn injuries were evaluated for time of reepithelialization, graft take, disability (WHODAS2.0) and quality of life (EQ5D-3L) up to 3 months post-injury, as an indication of effectiveness. RESULTS: Patients presented on average at 5 days after injury (SD 11, median 1, IQR 0-4). Three patients died at admission. The remaining 79 were included in the cohort. Their median age was 3 years (IQR 2-9, range 0.5-49), mean TBSA burned 12% (SD10%) and mortality rate 11.4%. No surgery-related mortality or life-threatening complications were observed. Skin grafting was performed on 29 patients at a delayed stage (median 23 days, IQR 15-47). Complications of skin grafts included partial (25% of procedures) and complete graft necrosis (8% of procedures). The mean time to reepithelialization was 52 (SD 42) days after admission. Disability and quality of life improved from admission to 3 months after injury (p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively).

Amref Health Africa has partnered with Smile Train to provide CLP surgeries since 2006. METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data of 37,274 CLP patients from the Smile Train database operated on in eastern and central Africa between 2006 and 2014. Cases were analyzed by age, gender, country and surgery type. The impact of cleft surgery was determined by measuring averted Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and delayed averted DALYs. We used mean Smile Train costs to calculate cost-effectiveness. We calculated economic benefit using the human capital approach and Value of Statistical Life (VSL) methods. RESULTS: The median age at time of primary surgery was 5.4 years. A total of 207,879 DALYs were averted at a total estimated cost of US$13 million. Mean averted DALYs per patient were 5.6, and mean cost per averted DALY was $62.8. Total delayed burden of disease from late age at surgery was 36,352 DALYs. Surgical correction resulted in $292 million in economic gain using the human capital approach and $2.4 billion using VSL methods.

The aim of this study was to characterize the spectrum of disease and operative procedures at a teaching hospital in Maputo, Mozambique to help understand the challenges of providing care for the local providers and to provide contextual relevance for training through partnerships. METHODS: A mixed-methods approach was utilized to perform an ongoing needs assessment. A retrospective review was performed of plastic surgery operative records, ward admissions records, and death records in a tertiary-care hospital in Maputo, Mozambique for the period January 2015 to December 2015. RESULTS: Limited resources (equipment, block-time, personnel, and perioperative services) were observed. The most common diagnoses for the 455 patients evaluated were burns (44%) and neoplasms (17%). Congenital abnormalities accounted for only 1% of the patient diagnoses. Of the 408 procedures performed, the majority were skin grafts (43%) and skin excisions (31%). Sepsis from burns accounted for 70% of documented deaths (14/20). The mean number of days to skin grafting for inpatients was 53 days.

This study sought to describe the short-term independent effect of a surgical residency program on trauma mortality at a tertiary trauma center in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of all patients recorded in the trauma surveillance registry of Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi, from 2009 (three residents) through 2014 (11 residents). Log-binominal regression modeling was used to compare the risk ratio of death compared to the referent year of 2009, when the program was started, after adjusting for relevant covariates. Primary injury type was used as a surrogate for injury severity. RESULTS: In total, 82,534 patients were recorded into the KCH Trauma Registry during the study period. Mean age was 23.1 years (SD 15.7) with a male preponderance (72.1%). Trauma patient volume increased from 8725 patients in 2009 to 15,998 patients in 2014. Each year had a significantly decreased risk of death compared to 2009 when adjusted for primary injury type, age, and gender, with an adjusted risk ratio of 0.73 (95% CI 0.58, 0.90) in 2010 and 0.52 (95% CI 0.43, 0.62) in 2014. CONCLUSION: The global burden of surgical diseases cannot be attenuated in the presence of an inadequate surgical workforce.

However, no country-specific data currently exist. We aimed to estimate the costs to the Sierra Leone economy from death and disability which may have been averted by surgical care. DESIGN: We used estimates of total, met and unmet need from two main sources-a cluster randomised, cross-sectional, countrywide survey and a retrospective, nationwide study on surgery in Sierra Leone. We calculated estimated disability-adjusted life years from morbidity and mortality for the estimated unmet burden and modelled the likely economic impact using three different methods-gross national income per capita, lifetime earnings foregone and value of a statistical life. RESULTS: In 2012, estimated, discounted lifetime losses to the Sierra Leone economy from the unmet burden of surgical disease was between US$1.1 and US$3.8 billion, depending on the economic method used. These lifetime losses equate to between 23% and 100% of the annual GDP for Sierra Leone. 80% of economic losses were due to mortality.

B.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the burden of surgical disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa, where district and rural hospitals are the main providers of care. The present study sought to analyze what is known about the met and unmet need of surgical disease. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of surveys in rural areas, information on surgical admissions, and operations performed within rural and district hospitals. Data were extrapolated to calculate the amount of surgical disease per 100,000 population and the number of operations performed per 100,000 population. These extrapolations were used to estimate the total, the met, and the unmet need of surgical disease. RESULTS: The estimated overall incidence of nonfatal injury is at least 1,690/100,000 population per year. Morbidity as a result of injury is up to 190/100,000 population per year, and the annual mortality from injury is 53-92/100,000. District hospitals perform 6 fracture reductions (95% CI: 0.1-12)/100,000 population per year and 14 laparotomies (95% CI: 7-21)/100,000 per year. The incidence of peritonitis and bowel obstruction is unknown, although it may be as high as 1,364/100,000 population for the acute abdomen. The annual total need for inguinal hernia repair is estimated to be a minimum of 205/100,000 population. The average district hospital performs 30 hernia repairs (95% CI: 18-41)/100,000 population per year, leaving an unmet need of 175/100,000 population annually.

The purpose of this investigation was to determine the burden of emergency procedures on pediatric surgical capacity in Uganda and to determine health metrics that capture surgical backlog and effective coverage of children's surgical disease in low- and middle-income countries. METHODS: We reviewed 2 independent and prospectively collected databases on pediatric surgical admissions at Mulago National Referral Hospital and Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital in Uganda. Pediatric surgical patients admitted at either hospital between October 2015 to June 2017 were included. Our primary outcome was the distribution of surgical acuity and associated mortality. RESULTS: A combined total of 1,930 patients were treated at the two hospitals, and 1,110 surgical procedures were performed. There were 571 emergency cases (51.6%), 108 urgent cases (9.7%), and 429 elective cases (38.6%). Overall mortality correlated with surgical acuity. Emergency intestinal diversions for colorectal congenital malformations (anorectal malformations and Hirschsprung's disease) to elective definitive repair was 3:1. Additionally, 30% of inguinal hernias were incarcerated or strangulated at time of repair. CONCLUSION: Emergency and urgent operations utilize the majority of operative resources for pediatric surgery groups in low- and middle-income countries, leading to a backlog of complex congenital procedures.

Recent global children's surgical guidelines suggest training and support of general surgeons in rural regional hospitals as an effective approach to increasing pediatric surgical capacity. METHODS: Two years of a prospective clinical database of children's surgery admissions at 2 regional referral hospitals in Uganda were reviewed. Primary outcomes included case volume and clinical outcomes of children at each hospital. Additionally, the disability-adjusted life-years averted by delivery of pediatric surgical services at these hospitals were calculated. Using a value of statistical life calculation, we also estimated the economic benefit of the pediatric surgical care currently being delivered. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, more than 300 surgical procedures were performed at each hospital per year. The majority of cases were standard general surgery cases including hernia repairs and intussusception as well as procedures for surgical infections and trauma. In-hospital mortality was 2.4% in Soroti and 1% in Lacor. Pediatric surgical capacity at these hospitals resulted in over 12,400 disability-adjusted life-years averted/year.

METHODS: We conducted a study to calculate the costs and the DALYs averted by an entire hospital in Sierra Leone, using the method suggested by McCord and Chowdhury (Int J Gynaecol Obstet 2003;81:83-92). RESULTS: For the 3-month study period, total costs were calculated to be dollar 369,774. Using the approach of McCord and Chowdhury, we calculated that 11,282 DALYs were averted during the study period, resulting in a cost/DALY averted of dollar 32.78. This figure compares favorably to other non-surgical health interventions in developing countries. We found that while surgery accounts for 63% of total caseload, it contributes to 38% of the total DALYs averted.

In this article we describe the epidemiology of pediatric surgical diseases observed in Mutoyi hospital, a first-level hospital in Burundi. Methods and Findings: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all children (0–14 years) admitted to the Surgery ward from January 2017 to December 2017. We also reviewed the records of all the patients admitted to the Neonatology ward in 2017 and among them we selected the ones in which a surgical diagnosis was present. Five hundred twenty-eight children were admitted to the surgical ward during the study period. The most common conditions requiring hospitalization were abscesses (29.09%), fractures (13.59%), osteomyelitis (9.76%), burns (5.40%) and head injuries (4.36%). The average length of stay was 16 days. Fifty-six newborns were admitted to the Neonatology ward for a surgical condition; 29% of them had an abscess. Conclusions: Conditions requiring surgical care are frequent in Burundian children and have a completely different spectrum from the western ones.

Results: The review encompasses 235 noma cases. Twenty-four cases (19 females and 5 males) experienced various complications, predominately major complications leading to subsequent revision surgeries. The identified complications included flap necrosis, abscess formation, tenderness, graft site infection, flap bulking, dental misalignment, corner of the mouth dehiscence, infected bone and plate, flap malpositioning, restricted mouth opening with ankylosis, neuropathic pain, recurrent flap infection, and offensive odor. Revision surgeries included wound cleansing, abscess drainage, skin graft removal, exploratory surgery, wound care, debulking, scar removal, debridement, trismus release, commisuroplasty, and flap repositioning. Conclusion: These findings illuminate the intricacies of noma surgery in Ethiopia, emphasizing the importance of understanding the nature and frequency of complications for optimizing treatment outcomes.

B.","Background Surgical conditions contribute significantly to the disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there is an apparent neglect of surgical care as a public health intervention to counter this burden. There is increasing enthusiasm to reverse this trend, by promoting essential surgical services at the district hospital, the first point of contact for critical conditions for rural populations. This study investigated the scope of surgery conducted at district hospitals in three sub-Saharan African countries. Methods and Findings In a retrospective descriptive study, field data were collected from eight district hospitals in Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique using a standardized form and interviews with key informants. Overall, the scope of surgical procedures performed was narrow and included mainly essential and life-saving emergency procedures. Surgical output varied across hospitals from five to 45 major procedures/10,000 people. Obstetric operations were most common and included cesarean sections and uterine evacuations. Hernia repair and wound care accounted for 65% of general surgical procedures. The number of beds in the studied hospitals ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 per 1,000 population. Conclusion The findings of this study clearly indicate low levels of surgical care provision at the district level for the hospitals studied. The extent to which this translates into unmet need remains unknown although the very low proportions of live births in the catchment areas of these eight hospitals that are born by cesarean section suggest that there is a substantial unmet need for surgical services. The district hospital in the current health system in sub-Saharan Africa lends itself to feasible integration of essential surgery into the spectrum of comprehensive primary care services. It is therefore critical that the surgical capacity of the district hospital is significantly expanded; this will result in sustainable preventable morbidity and mortality. © 2010 Galukande et al.",2010,NA,PLoS Medicine,7,3,1-10,NA,10.1371/journal.pmed.1000243,21877,Galukande 2010,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-04 04:42:30)(Select): interesting paper/good insights. certainly useful; Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-04 04:41:00)(Select): surgical capacity ; barriers

Methods: This is a retrospective database analysis of prospectively collected data from all patients recorded in the burn registry between June 2011 and August 2014 located at the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Unit in Lilongwe, Malawi. We utilized activity-based costing, a bottom-up cost analysis methodology with cost allocation that allows determination of unit cost or cost per service. Results: 905 patients were admitted to the burn unit during the study period. The calculated total monthly burn expenditure for all cost centers was $11,622.66. Per day, the total unit cost was $387.42 with a mean daily per-patient cost of $24.26 (SD +/- $6.44). Consequently, the mean cost per in-patient admission was $559.85 (SD +/- $736.17). The mean daily cost per 1% total burn surface per patient at our center is $2.65 (SD +/- $3.01). Discussion: This burn care cost analysis study helps quantify the relative contribution of differing cost centers that comprise burn care delivery and hospital costs in a sub-Saharan African setting. Accurate and relevant cost information on hospital services at the patient level is therefore fundamental for policy makers, payers, and hospitals. Conclusion: Our study has demonstrated that comprehensive burn care is possible at a cost much lower than found in other burn centers in low or middle-income countries and can be sustained with moderate funding.

However, in a resource-limited setting, operative capacity often limits patient access to surgical intervention. This study sought to describe access to excision and grafting for adult burn patients in a sub-Saharan African burn unit and its relationship with burn-associated mortality. METHODS: We analyzed patients recorded in the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Registry in Lilongwe, Malawi from 2011-2019. We examined patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes for adults aged ≥16 years. Modified Poisson regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-three patients were included. Median age was 30 years (IQR 23-40) with a male preponderance (63%). Median percent total body surface area burned (%TBSA) was 15% (IQR 8-26) and 68% of burns were caused by flame. 27% (n = 154) had burn excision with skin grafting, with a median time to operation of 18 days (IQR 9-38). When adjusted for age, %TBSA, and time to presentation, operative intervention conferred a survival benefit for patients with flame burns with a RR 0.16 (95% CI 0.06, 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In a resource-limiting setting, access to the operating room is inadequate, and burn patients are not prioritized.

Building paediatric surgical capacity to meet SSA country needs is a priority. This study aimed to assess district hospital paediatric surgical capacity in three countries: Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia (MTZ). Methods: Data from 67 district-level hospitals in MTZ were collected using a PediPIPES survey tool. Its five components are procedures, personnel, infrastructure, equipment, and supplies. A PediPIPES Index was calculated for each country, and a two-tailed analysis of variance test was used to explore cross-country comparisons. Results: Similar paediatric surgical capacity index scores and shortages were observed across countries, greater in Malawi and less in Tanzania. Almost all hospitals reported the capacity to perform common minor surgical procedures and less complex resuscitation interventions. Capacity to undertake common abdominal, orthopaedic and urogenital procedures varied—more often reported in Malawi and less often in Tanzania. There were no paediatric or general surgeons or anaesthesiologists at district hospitals. General medical officers with some training to do surgery on children were present (more often in Zambia).

A retrospective cohort analysis comparing characteristics of patients presenting to the CLP clinic in the year prior to (2016) and 2 years following (2017–2018) the implementation of the blast SMS text messaging system is performed to assess its impact. Results: Patients presenting to a single Zimbabwean CLP surgical program in the years with SMS messaging notifications were significantly more likely (52 [64%] vs. 5 [17%], P <.001) to have been informed of surgical services through their mobile phones. The average distance traveled per patient was not significantly different prior to implementation of mass text messaging (180.4 km [SD114.8] vs. 167.4 km [SD105.9], P =.580). The average patient age was significantly higher following the implementation of mass text messaging (7.4 [SD8.7] vs. 3.0 [SD2.8] years, P =.010). Conclusions: SMS messaging is an effective method of informing patients of CLP surgical services in resource-limited settings. After implementation of SMS text notifications, surgical patients were of increased age, but showed no difference in distance traveled.

The goal of our study is to describe the face, head, and neck (FHN) conditions that need surgical care in Uganda, along with barriers to that care and disability from these conditions. METHODS: A 2-stage cluster randomized SOSAS survey was administered in a cross-sectional manner between August and September 2014. Participants included randomly selected persons in 105 enumeration areas in 74 districts throughout Uganda with 24 households in each cluster. The SOSAS survey collected demographic and clinical data on all respondents. Univariate and multivariate logistic models evaluated associations of demographic characteristics and clinical characteristics of the FHN conditions and outcomes of whether health care was sought or surgical care was received. RESULTS: Of the 4428 respondents, 331 (7.8%) reported having FHN conditions. The most common types of conditions were injury-related wounds. Of those who reported an FHN condition, 36% reported receiving no surgical care whereas 82.5% reported seeking health care. In the multivariate model, literacy and type of condition were significant predictors of seeking health care whereas village type, literacy, and type of condition remained significant predictors of receiving surgical care.

This study aimed to assess whether a single surgical intervention was sufficient to produce an observable change to the life of a patient with cleft lip living in rural Hararghe in eastern Ethiopia. METHODS: 356 patients with isolated cleft lips, who received a single surgical treatment at least 6 months previously, were evaluated in 21 rural health centres. RESULTS: Patients and their families expressed unhappiness before treatment, mainly because the society reacted negatively towards the deformities, isolating the patients from community activities. Postoperatively, the percentage of school-aged children participating in education increased from 46% to 79%, some older patients were able to marry, but employment was unaffected. The prevalence of wound dehiscence in the lip repair was 3% and occurred more frequently in patients with a bilateral cleft lip compared to a unilateral cleft lip (p < 0.001, RR 49.25, 95% CI 6.7-1037.35).

This study evaluated the characteristics of motorcycle-related RTIs, the quality of care received, and the outcome of the patients managed in a trauma reference center in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS:  This is a prospective cohort study. All patients involved in motorcycle road traffic crashes who presented to the emergency department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, between August 2020 and May 2021, were included in the study. Data on patients' demographics, history of the crash, injuries sustained, definitive care, and the outcome of in-hospital care were obtained from patients (and/or their carers) and the medical records. RESULTS:  A total of 156 patients were seen, out of which 74.4% were males. About 76.2% were less than 45 years with a mean age of 35.7 ± 16.3 years, and the peak age group was 18-44 years. About 37 (23.7%) patients were involved in motorcycle/motorcycle collisions, whereas 67 (42.9%) were involved in motorcycle/car collisions. Riders accounted for 59.6% (93), and although 62% (97) of the patients presented within six hours of the crash, only 10.9% (17) presented within one hour. About 48% received some form of prehospital care rendered by officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps, police officers, or passers-by, and none was attended by a dedicated emergency ambulance team. The head and the limbs were the most affected anatomical areas, while orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures were the most required emergency surgical interventions.

G.","IMPORTANCE: Surgical care is widely unavailable in developing countries; advocates recommend that countries evaluate and report on access to surgical care to improve availability and aid health planners in decision making. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the infrastructure, capacity, and availability of surgical care in Zambia to inform health policy priorities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this observational study, all hospitals providing surgical care were identified in cooperation with the Zambian Ministry of Health. On-site data collection was conducted from February 1 through August 30, 2011, with an adapted World Health Organization Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care survey. Data collection at each facility included interviews with hospital personnel and assessment of material resources. Data were geocoded and analyzed in a data visualization platform from March 1 to December 1, 2015. We analyzed time and distance to surgical services, as well as the proportion of the population living within 2 hours from a facility providing surgical care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Surgical capacity, supplies, human resources, and infrastructure at each surgical facility, as well as the population living within 2 hours from a hospital providing surgical care. RESULTS: Data were collected from all 103 surgical facilities identified as providing surgical care. When including all surgical facilities (regardless of human resources and supplies), 14.9% of the population (2 166 460 of 14 500 000 people) lived more than 2 hours from surgical care. However, only 17 hospitals (16.5%) met the World Health Organization minimum standards of surgical safety; when limiting the analysis to these hospitals, 65.9% of the population (9 552 780 people) lived in an area that was more than 2 hours from a surgical facility. Geographic analysis of emergency and essential surgical care, defined as access to trauma care, obstetric care, and care of common abdominal emergencies, found that 80.7% of the population (11 704 700 people) lived in an area that was more than 2 hours from these surgical facilities. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A large proportion of the population in Zambia does not have access to safe and timely surgical care; this percentage would change substantially if all surgical hospitals were adequately resourced.

Changes noted in the 2007 to 2009 time period: more patients had burn diagrams (48.6 vs 27.6%, P < .001), received analgesics (91 vs 84%, P = .05), resuscitation fluid (56 vs 49%, P = not significant [NS]), topical antimicrobials (40 vs 37%, P = NS), underwent skin grafting (35.5 vs 25.1%, P = NS), and underwent any operative intervention (40.6 vs 35.2%, P = NS), compared with patients treated between 2002 and 2006. This study represents the largest, most comprehensive burn data set for a sub-Saharan region in Africa. There has been a statistically significant improvement in documentation of burn size as well as administration of analgesics, validating the efficacy of the ABA/CBF-sponsored burn teams.

The purpose of this study was to determine the change that had occurred in the number of patients treated for cleft lip and palate during the five-year period from 2001-2005. Patients and Methods: This is a retrospective review of cleft lip and palate operations carried out under general anesthesia at the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. Operating room records were the source of data. Patients treated under local anesthesia were excluded. Information collected included age, gender, and diagnosis. The results were displayed in tables and graphs. Results: A total of 344 patients were operated for cleft lip and palate during the five-year period, i.e. 69 operations per year. The patients comprised 58% males and 42% females and ranged in age from 1 month to 32 years with a mean age of 3.9 years. Unilateral cleft lip operations constituted 78% of all operations. Each succeeding year saw an increase in the number of operations being carried out year during the five-year period. Conclusion: The marked increase in the number of cleft operations per year in our hospital during the period under study was probably due to greater awareness in the community; free surgeries provided by local surgeons with financial support from a US-based NGO; and free operations by a visiting surgical team.

This systematic review aims to geographically map the research activities through scientific publications of African PS centres, between February 2012-February 2023. Methods: We searched four literature databases (Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and African Journal Online) and did a manual search. We included case reports, randomised controlled trials, and clinical, comparative, observational and multicentre studies conducted in Africa and published in English and French. In the Google Scholar database, we analysed the first 200 references (scientific articles) selected per relevance according to the Boolean terms. In the African Journals Online database, we analysed the references from the first five pages. The selected keywords were: burns, trauma reconstruction, pressure injuries, wound, cleft lip and palate, breast reconstruction, microsurgery, aesthetic surgery, face surgery, head and neck surgery, hand surgery, open fracture surgery, oculoplastic surgery, skin surgery, and soft tissue surgery.

In Ethiopia, burn was the second leading cause of death among children from unintentional injuries. So far, no research had been conducted regarding the treatment outcomes of burn n children, particularly at DCSH. Objective: To evaluate burn treatment outcomes and associated factors in children who visited DCSH, 2021. Methods: An institutional based cross-sectional study design and simple random sampling method was used to select the study participants. A total of 250 charts of hospitalized children from September 1, 2011 to August 30, 2015 were reviewed. Cronbach's alpha test was done on the data collecting tool which scored 0.8. Data were entered, cleaned using Epi-Data version 4.6, and analysed using SPSS version 20. P-values less than 0.2 in binary logistic regression were entered in multivariable logistic regression. Finally, P-values less than 0.05 were considered significant factors for poor treatment outcomes of burns. Result: This study showed that 27.6% (95 %CI: 22.4%–33.5%) of patients had poor burn treatment outcomes.

METHODS: This is a retrospective analysis of burn patients (<18 years old) presenting to Kamuzu Central Hospital from 2011 to 2022. We compared patients who underwent excision and/or burn grafting based on the timing of the operation. We used logistic regression modeling to estimate the adjusted odds ratio of death based on the timing of surgery. RESULTS: We included 2502 patients with a median age of 3 years (IQR 1-5) and a male preponderance (56.8%). 411 patients (16.4%) had surgery with a median time to surgery of 18 days (IQR 8-34).

OBJECTIVE: Socioeconomic costs of orthopedic injuries were estimated by examining both the direct hospital cost of orthopedic care as well as indirect costs of orthopedic trauma using disability days and loss of work as proxies. METHODS: This study surveyed 200 patients seen in the outpatient orthopedic ward of the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center, a tertiary hospital in Northeastern Tanzania, during the month of July 2016. FINDINGS: Of the patients surveyed, 88.8% earn a monthly income of less than $250 and the majority of patients (73.7%) reported that the healthcare costs of their musculoskeletal injuries were a catastrophic burden to them and their family with 75.0% of patients reporting their medical costs exceeded their monthly income. The majority (75.3%) of patients lost more than 30 days of activities of daily living due to their injury, with a median (IQR) functional day loss of 90 (30). Post-injury disability led to 40.6% of patients losing their job and 86.7% of disabled patients reported a wage decrease post-injury. There were significant associations between disability and post-injury unemployment (p < .0001) as well as lower post-injury wages (p = .022).

C.","PURPOSE: Currently, no nationally implementable survey exists to identify the burden of hand and upper extremity conditions at the household level in low-middle income countries (LMICs). This study describes a randomized cluster survey approach to estimating the burden of hand and upper extremity conditions in four LMICs using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey. Additionally, this study identifies factors associated with responses of unmet surgical need at the multinational level. METHODS: The SOSAS instrument is a cluster-randomized, cross-sectional, countrywide survey of households administered in Nepal, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda from 2011 to 2014. We identified nationwide trends for sociodemographic, anatomic, condition type, mechanism, prevalence, subjective disability, and barriers to care for upper extremity survey responses. A multivariable model identified factors associated with unmet upper extremity need across the four nations. RESULTS: Across the four countries, 13,763 individuals participated in the survey, with 883 conditions of the upper extremity identified (7.4% of all surgical conditions surveyed). Fractures accompanied many of the injuries (32.3%). Although most conditions were acquired, congenital conditions comprised 11% of all etiologies. Overall, open fire/explosion was the most common mechanism (22.9%). Rwandans had the highest proportion of individuals seeking care (91.0%) and receiving care (88.6%). Sierra Leone indicated the fewest seeking and receiving care (71% and 63%, respectively). Chronic injuries were significantly associated with receiving care, whereas illiteracy and worsening subjective disability were barriers to receiving care. CONCLUSIONS: In this survey of upper extremity conditions from four LMICs, upper extremity conditions primarily resulted from fire/explosions, and many reported sustaining a fracture. Illiteracy and more disabling conditions decreased the odds of receiving care by 30% to 40%, respectively. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The SOSAS survey may provide a reproducible means to evaluate the unmet need for upper extremity care across similar LMICs.",2024,NA,J Hand Surg Am,NA,NA,NA,38878030,10.1016/j.jhsa.2024.02.008,14935,Davé 2024,NA,NA,NA,"Burden & Outcome, Congenital Malformations, Trauma",Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,No,Congenital Malformations; Trauma,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,No

Higher-income countries had a higher ratio of cleft palate repairs. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest proportion of cleft palate repairs. Methods: Data were obtained from the Smile Train database of 352,191 consecutive cleft operations performed between 2008 and 2011 in low- to higher-middle-income countries. The ratio of cleft lip to palate repair was analyzed as a function of geographic region and by country income (gross national income). Conclusion: This study emphasizes that many babies born with cleft palates in resource-poor regions do not have their palates repaired. This finding may be explained by an increased neonatal mortality in cleft palate babies. Furthermore, fewer isolated palatal clefts may present to an appropriate health care facility or there may be a reluctance to treat cleft palate due to concerns regarding higher perioperative risks or the lack of available surgical and anesthetic expertise.

All resources used at district hospitals for the delivery of surgery were identified and quantified. The hospital departments were divided into three categories of cost centres-the final cost centre, intermediate and ancillary cost centres. All costs of human resources, buildings, equipment, medical and non-medical supplies and utilities were quantified and allocated to surgery through step-down accounting. The total cost of surgery, including post-operative care, ranged from US$ 329,000 per year to more than twice that amount at one of the hospitals. At two hospitals, it represented 16-17% of the total cost of running the hospital. The main cost drivers of surgery were transport and inpatient services, including catering. The cost of a C-section ranged from $ 164 to 638 that of a hernia repair from $ 137 to 598. Evacuations from uterus were cheapest mainly because of the shorter duration of patient stay. Low bed occupancy rates and utilisation rates of the operating theatres suggest overcapacity but may also indicate a potential to scale up surgery. This may be achieved by adding surgical staff, although there may be rate-limiting steps, such as demand for surgery in the community or capacity to provide anaesthesia.

However, access to reconstructive surgery is limited in developing countries. The present study reviews epidemiological data from a single charitable organization, Smile Train, with a database of surgical cases from 33 African countries from 2001-2011. Methods: Demographic and clinical patient data were collected from questionnaires completed by the participating surgeons. These data were recorded in Excel, analyzed using SPSS and compared with previously reported data. Results: Questionnaires were completed for 36,384 patients by 389 African surgeons. The distribution of clefts was: 34.44% clefts of the lip (CL), 58.87% clefts of the lip and palate (CLP), and 6.69% clefts of the palate only (CP). The male to female ratio was 1.46:1, and the unilateral: bilateral ratio 2.93:1, with left-sided predominance 1.69:1. Associated anomalies were found in 4.18% of patients. The most frequent surgeries included primary lip/nose repairs, unilateral (68.36%) and bilateral (11.84%). There was seasonal variation in the frequency of oral cleft births with the highest in January and lowest by December. The average age at surgery was 9.34 years and increased in countries with lower gross domestic products. The average hospital stay was 4.5 days. The reported complication rate was 1.92%. Conclusions: With the exception of cleft palates, results follow trends of worldwide epidemiologic reports of 25% CL, 50% CLP, and 25% CP, 2:1 unilateral:bilateral and left:right ratios, and male predominance. Fewer than expected patients, especially females, presented with isolated cleft palates, suggesting that limitations in economic resources and cultural aesthetics of the obvious lip deformity may outweigh functional concerns and access to treatment for females. A fewer than expected associated anomalies suggests either true ethnic variation, or that more severely-affected patients are not presenting for treatment.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of pediatric surgical conditions across Somaliland using a nationwide community-based household survey. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted through a national community-based sampling survey from August through December 2017 in Somaliland. Participants were 1503 children surveyed using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The SOSAS survey contains 2 components, including a section on household demographics, deaths, and financial information and sections querying children's history of surgical conditions. RESULTS: In this cross-sectional study that included 1503 children (55.6% male; mean [SE] age, 6.4 [0.1] years), 221 surgical conditions were identified among 196 children, yielding a mean (SE) prevalence of pediatric surgical conditions of 12.2% (1.5%).

There is very little evidence as to the feasibility and outcomes of microsurgery performed in East Africa. This study will analyse outcomes of 114 consecutive free flaps, performed over 6 years at a single plastic surgery unit in Uganda. It aims to demonstrate that despite its challenges, successful microsurgical practice can be set up in East Africa. Methods and patients The notes of 100 consecutive patients who underwent 114 free flaps between 01/06/2009 and 01/07/2015 at CoRSU Hospital, Uganda were analysed. Results One hundred and fourteen free flaps were performed on 100 patients. The types of free flaps used included free fibula (n = 41), ALT (n = 30), gracillis (n = 8), radial forearm (n = 7), latissimus dorsi (n = 9) and rectus (n = 7) amongst others (n = 12). The most common indications for surgery were head and neck cancer (n = 50), trauma (n = 19), osteomyelitis (n = 18), burns (n = 13), head and neck infection (n = 6). Over the six year period there was an overall 76% survival of the flaps. However in the last two years of the series there was a flap survival rate of over 93% (n = 50). There were 40 non-microsurgical complications including wound infection (n = 10) and graft loss (n = 8). Conclusion This is one of the first studies to report on the outcomes of free flaps performed at an East African centre.

National Health Strategic Plans (NHSPs) reflect countries' long-term health priorities, plans and targets. These plans were analysed to assess the prioritisation of surgery as a public health issue in Africa. METHODS: NHSPs of 43 independent Sub-Saharan African countries available in the public domain in March 2014 in French or English were searched electronically for key terms: surg*, ortho*, trauma, cancer, appendic*, laparotomy, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria. They were then searched manually for disease prevalence, targets, and human resources. RESULTS: 19 % of NHSPs had no mention of surgery or surgical conditions. 63 % had five or less mentions of surgery. HIV and malaria had 3772 mentions across all the policies, compared to surgery with only 376 mentions. Trauma had 239 mentions, while the common surgical conditions of appendicitis, laparotomy and hernia had no mentions at all. Over 95 % of NHSPs specifically mentioned the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, infant mortality and maternal mortality. Whereas, the most commonly mentioned surgical condition for which a prevalence was given was trauma, in only 47 % of policies. All NHSPs had plans and measurable targets for the reduction of HIV and tuberculosis. Of the total 4064 health targets, only 2 % were related to surgical conditions or surgical care. 33 % of policies had no surgical targets. DISCUSSION: NHSPs are the best available measure of health service and planning priorities.

R.; Sander, B.","Objective: The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review that summarizes the cost-effectiveness of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on existing literature. Design: We searched eleven electronic databases for articles from January 1, 2000 to December 29, 2020. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020148402). Two reviewers independently conducted primary and secondary screening, and data extraction. Setting: All CL/P cost-effectiveness analyses in LMIC settings. Patients, Participants: In total, 2883 citations were screened. Eleven articles encompassing 1,001,675 patients from 86 LMICs were included. Main Outcome Measures: We used cost-effectiveness thresholds of 1% to 51% of a country's gross domestic product per capita (GDP/capita), a conservative threshold recommended for LMICs. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Results: Primary CL/P repair was cost-effective at the threshold of 51% of a country's GDP/capita across all studies. However, only 1 study met at least 70% of the JBI criteria. There is a need for context-specific cost and health outcome data for primary CL/P repair, complications, and existing multidisciplinary management in LMICs. Conclusions: Existing economic evaluations suggest primary CL/P repair is cost-effective, however context-specific local data will make future cost-effectiveness analyses more relevant to local decision-makers and lead to better-informed resource allocation decisions in LMICs.",2023,NA,Cleft Palate Craniofacial Journal,60,12,1600-1608,NA,10.1177/10556656221111028,15815,Chung 2023,NA,Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations; Cost,"Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations","Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations, Systematic Review",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,Yes,Congenital Malformations,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

R.; Sander, B.","IMPORTANCE: In Ethiopia, more than 70% of infants with cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) lack access to surgery. Infants who are untreated can experience severe malnutrition and extreme social stigma resulting in abandonment. Utilities are standardized measures of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) that inform health care resource allocation. However, CL/P utilities are missing from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). OBJECTIVE: To elicit utilities for untreated and surgically treated children with CL/P with consideration for social determinants of health from patient-proxy and societal participants. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used patient proxies and societal participants in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from July 1, 2019, to January 30, 2020. Eligible patient proxies were caregivers of children younger than 18 years with nonsyndromic CL/P who were untreated or received surgery. Proxies were necessary as most patients were 0 to 4 years old and cannot reliably self-report. Eligible societal participants were 18 years and older with no family history of CL/P. EXPOSURES: Surgical treatment and social determinants of health. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Participants measured utilities using the visual analog scale (VAS), time trade-off (TTO), and standard gamble (SG). RESULTS: In this study, 312 patient proxies and 135 societal participants were recruited. Mean (SD) utilities for untreated CL/P ranged from 0.57 (0.23) to 0.70 (0.22) from patient proxies and from 0.35 (0.21) to 0.8 (0.23) from societal participants, depending on utility instrument and cleft type. Surgical treatment was associated with a better HRQOL from the patient-proxy perspective (VAS, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.26; TTO, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.25) from the societal perspective (VAS, 0.21; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.26; TTO, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.22; SG, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.15). Social determinants of health that were associated with patient-proxy utilities were income above the national mean (VAS, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.17; TTO, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.20), and religion (Christian vs other: TTO, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.03). From the societal perspective, the association between treatment and utilities was smaller in females compared with males (TTO, -0.05; 95% CI, -0.10 to -0.01). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study suggest that CL/P disease severity and surgical impact in Ethiopia were undervalued by previous estimates from high-income countries and were associated with social determinants of health.

Ongoing insecurity has forced an inconsistent medical response by the international community, with little data collection. This paper describes the ""remote"" model of surgical care by Medecins Sans Frontieres, in Guri-El, Somalia. The challenges of providing the necessary prerequisites for safe surgery are discussed as well as the successes and limitations of task shifting in this resource-limited context. METHODS: In January 2006, MSF opened a project in Guri-El located between Mogadishu and Galcayo. The objectives were to reduce mortality due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth and from violent and non-violent trauma. At the start of the program, expatriate surgeons and anesthesiologists established safe surgical practices and performed surgical procedures. After January 2008, expatriates were evacuated due to insecurity and surgical care has been provided by local Somalian doctors and nurses with periodic supervisory visits from expatriate staff. RESULTS: Between October 2006 and December 2009, 2086 operations were performed on 1602 patients. The majority (1049, 65%) were male and the median age was 22 (interquartile range, 17-30). 1460 (70%) of interventions were emergent.

METHODS: We analysed data on all surgical interventions done at Masisi district hospital between September 2007 and December 2009.

These injuries exert a burden on the public health system, yet little information exists on health care resource usage by motorcycle crash injury patients. We aimed to estimate the burden of motorcycle crash injuries on the health system in Kisumu City. METHODS: We conducted a 6-month prospective study of all motorcycle crash injury patients who presented to 3 Tier III public and private hospitals in Kisumu City between May and November 2019. We collected data on demographics, emergency department (ED) visits, admissions, anatomic injury site, services used, and injury severity. We reviewed hospital records to obtain denominator data on all the conditions presenting to the EDs. RESULTS: A total of 1,073 motorcycle crash injury cases accounted for 2.0%, 12.0%, and 13.6% of total emergency visits, total injuries, and total admissions to the hospitals, respectively. Men were overrepresented (P<.001). The mean age was 29.6 years (±standard deviation [SD] 12.19; range=2-84). The average injury severity score was 12.83. Surgical interventions were required by 89.3% of patients admitted. Of the 123 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, 42.3% were due to motorcycle accident injuries. CONCLUSION: Motorcycle injuries impose a major burden on the Kisumu City public health system. Increased promotion and reinforcement of appropriate interventions and legislation can help prevent accidents and mitigate their consequences. Focusing on motorcycle injury prevention will reduce accident-related morbidity, hospitalization, severity, and fatalities and the impact on the public health system.",2023,NA,Glob Health Sci Pract,11,1,NA,36853633,10.9745/ghsp-d-22-00197,13977,Cholo 2023,"Sabina Rodriguez (2025-02-25 03:24:41)(Select): Nice break down of injuries by treatment and surgeries.

This medical record review of four rural hospitals provides baseline data on the burden of trauma in Malawi. Methods: We reviewed all outpatient, inpatient, and mortuary records for one full year at four of the 28 district hospitals in Malawi: Dedza in central Malawi, Mangochi in the east, Nkhata Bay in the north, and Thyolo in the south. We used descriptive and comparative statistics to examine characteristics of patients and the data file. Results: During 2012, 18,735 trauma patients were treated at the four district hospitals. Trauma cases accounted for 3.5% of the 541,170 patient visits. In total, 60.8% of trauma patients were male; 39.1% were 0-14 years old and 50.4% were 15-49 years old. The logbooks were missing information about the primary type of injury for 44.9% of patients and about injury cause for 82.7%. Of the recorded trauma diagnoses, the most common injuries were soft tissue injuries, fractures, and sprains. The most commonly reported causes of injuries were animal bites (mostly dog bites), road traffic injuries, assaults, burns, and falls. Conclusions: The development and implementation of improved methods for acquiring more complete, accurate, and useful trauma data in Malawi and other low-income countries requires addressing difficulties that might result in missing data.

This study determined the burden of hospitalization after burns on women's economic status and its associated HRQOL. METHODS: This was a three-month cross-sectional study of female patients ≥ 25 years, treated of mixed or full thickness burns in four teaching hospitals in south-east Nigeria, discharged between September-November, 2018. Study instruments were participants' case notes for socio-demographic and disease history, interviewer-administered questionnaires, namely-economic-burden-of-burns questionnaire and English version of the EuroQol Five-Dimensions-Three-Level Health Questionnaire for Nigeria. Data were collected on second- or third-day post-discharge through home visits or phone calls. This lasted for 13 weeks. RESULTS: A total of seventy-three female patients with burn were successfully enrolled. Most participants were married, fairly educated, mainly traders or housewives. Thirty-four (46.6%) had subjective estimated family monthly income below NGN 50,000 (low economic status). Participants' average monthly income reduced drastically after hospitalization. Their average family monthly income was NGN110,439 (USD307), while their average total expenses incurred during hospitalization was NGN691,093 (USD1,920). Almost all (93.2%) had at least one surgical intervention during management. Their average length of hospital stay was 35.4 days; eleven consequently lost their job. Many had moderate to severe economic burden of treatment; only eleven could bear all the treatment expenses independently. Anxiety/depression and pain/discomfort were common problems reported, However, these Euroqol dimensions varied according to their SES, education and occupation. Women in the low economic class were more inclined to poor HRQOL (Mean ± SD VAS = 53.33 ± 17.619) than women in high economic class (Mean ± SD VAS = 76.67 ± 21.794). CONCLUSION: Burns places high level of economic burden on women and unfortunately, Nigerian government's commitment to healthcare of burns patients is low.

Patients and Methods: Records of 48 consecutive patients with noma (cancrum oris) seen between July 2002 and November 2006 were reviewed for age, gender, clinical features, and management. Other reports on noma in HIV and AIDS in Zimbabwe were also reviewed. Results: There were 48 patients included; 35.4% (n = 17) were males, of which 64.7% (n = 11) were children (16 years and younger) and 35.3% (n = 6) were adults; 64.6% (n = 3 1) were females, Out of which 87.1% (n = 27) were children and 12.9% (n = 4) were adults. The average age was 14.2 years (range, 3 to 30 years) for males and 9.2 years (range, I to 36 years) for females. The average age for the entire group was I I years (range, I to 36 years). All patients were HIV-positive by the ELISA method. Only 13 patients had CD4 cell and CD8 cell count obtained, ranging from 10 to 594 cells/mu L with a CD4/CD8 ratio ranging from 0.02 to 0.45. Only 5 patients had microbiologic investigations conducted, isolating Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, group D Streptococcus, and group B hemolytic Streptococcus. Isolated cheek defect (37.5%) was most common, followed by the type I and type W defect (25% each). Administration of antibiotics, nutritional support, wound debridement, and sequestrectomy were conducted before definitive reconstructive surgery. Facial reconstruction was performed using distant and local advancement flaps. No bony reconstruction was performed. Satisfactory results were achieved with minimal infection and flap breakdown. Follow-up was difficult; patients were lost to follow-up within 6 to 12 months after surgery. Conclusion: Noma cases are on the increase in line with the current HIV and AIDS epidemic. Female children appear to be more commonly affected than their male counterparts. Reconstructive surgery is possible in patients with low CD4/CD8 ratios because of HIV infection.

The secure electronic database of all admissions was reviewed for age, gender, weight, burn percentage (TBSA%), body part burned, cause/place of injury, length of stay, underweight status, surgery performed, reason for discharge, and mortality. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the variables associated with mortality. Kaplan-Meier curves were also analyzed. A total of 211 cases (59.7% male) admitted from March 2013 to June 2014 were reviewed. The median age, %TBSA, and length of stay were 2.0 years (1.3-3.3), 8.0% (5.0-13.4), and 8.5 days (4-14).

This study examines surgical care delivery metrics at a tertiary care institution in Liberia. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed operative and ward logbooks from January 1 to December 31, 2012. Data parameters included patients' age, diagnosis, procedure, mortality, and perioperative provider information. RESULTS: In 2012, 1,036 operations were performed. The breakdown of adult surgical cases reveals 452 (45.1%) general surgery operations, 192 (18.5%) orthopedic operations, and 180 (17.4%) ophthalmic operations. Other significant case volume included urologic 53 (5.1%), ENT 36 (3.5%), neurosurgical 31 (3.0%), vascular 24 (2.3%), and plastic 14 (1.4%) operations. Pediatric patients accounted for 24.5% (243) of surgical cases, and 9% of pediatric surgical cases were for hydrocephalus. General, spinal, and total intravenous anesthesia was provided by non-physician personnel, except when surgeons provided their own anesthesia. Ward logs documented 7.4% mortality among all patients admitted to the surgical ward, most of which occurred after exploratory laparotomy (44%), in burn (14%) patients, and in patients with head/neck emergencies (12%). CONCLUSIONS: This operative log review can be used to identify surgical practice patterns, needs, and deficits in order to inform the growth of surgical capacity at Liberia's only tertiary medical institution. Using this data to identify critical areas of high-yield operations (e.g., for pediatric hydrocephalus), or excessively high mortality rates (e.g., in burn care), can focus the direction of limited resources toward areas of need.

Although many individual case reports exist, no comprehensive evaluation of Marjolin's ulcer patients has been conducted in our setting. This study was conducted to describe the clinicopathological presentation and treatment outcome of this condition in our local setting and to identify predictors of outcome. Methods: This was a retrospective study of histologically confirmed cases of Marjolin's ulcer seen at Bugando Medical Centre over a period of 10-years between January 2001 and December 2010. Data were retrieved from patients' files and analyzed using SPSS computer software version 15.0 Results: A total of 56 patients were studied. Male to female ratio was 2.1:1. Burn scars (89.3%) were the most common causative lesions of Marjolin's ulcer. The mean latent period between original injury and diagnosis of Marjolin's ulcer was 11.34 +/- 6.14 years. Only 12.0% of the reported cases were grafted at the time of injury (P<0.00). Most patients (48.2%) presented between one and five years of onset of illness. The lower limb (42.9%) was the most frequent site for Marjolin's ulcers. The median tumor size at presentation was 8 cm and the vast majority of patients (85.7%) presented with large tumors of [greater than or equal to] 5 cm in diameter. Lymph node metastasis at the time of diagnosis was recorded in 32.1% of cases and distant metastasis accounted for 26.9% of cases. Squamous cell carcinoma (91.1%) was the most common histopathological type. Wide local excision was the most common surgical procedure performed in 80.8% of cases. Post-operative complication rate was 32.1% of which surgical site infection was the most common complication in 38.9% of patients. Local recurrence was noted in 33.3% of cases who were treated surgically. The mean length of hospital stay for in-patients was 7.9 +/- 2.3 days. Mortality rate was 7.1%. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, stage and grade of the tumor and presence of local recurrence were the main predictors of death (P < 0.001).

R.","OBJECTIVE: According to recent estimates, at least 11% of the total global burden of disease is attributable to surgically-treatable diseases. In children, the burden is even more striking with up to 85% of children in low-income and middle-income countries (LMIC) having a surgically-treatable condition by age 15. Using population data from four countries, we estimated pediatric surgical needs amongst children residing in LMICs. METHODS: A cluster randomized cross-sectional countrywide household survey (Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need) was done in four countries (Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Nepal and Uganda) and included demographics, a verbal head to toe examination, and questions on access to care. Global estimates regarding surgical need among children were derived from combined data, accounting for country-level clustering. RESULTS: A total of 13,806 participants were surveyed and 6,361 (46.1%) were children (0-18 years of age) with median age of 8 (Interquartile range [IQR]: 4-13) years. Overall, 19% (1,181/6,361) of children had a surgical need and 62% (738/1,181) of these children had at least one unmet need. Based on these estimates, the number of children living with a surgical need in these four LMICs is estimated at 3.7 million (95% CI: 3.4, 4.0 million). The highest percentage of unmet surgical conditions included head, face, and neck conditions, followed by conditions in the extremities. Over a third of the untreated conditions were masses while the overwhelming majority of treated conditions in all countries were wounds or burns. CONCLUSION: Surgery has been elevated as an ""indivisible, indispensable part of health care"" in LMICs and the newly formed 2015 Sustainable Development Goals are noted as unachievable without the provision of surgical care.

Globally, 11% of all disability-adjusted life-years lost result from conditions requiring surgery; however, little is known about country-specific burden. We piloted a household-based survey in a periurban district of Uganda to estimate the prevalence of surgical conditions and to identify logistical challenges. METHODS: Our sample comprised 57 households in 5 enumeration areas in the Wakiso District, in central Uganda. Our survey tool was the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical need. A household representative completed demographic and household death information, and 2 randomly selected household members completed questions on surgical conditions. RESULTS: Of 96 participants, 6 (6.3%; 95% CI, 2.3-13.1) had an existing, untreated surgical condition. The lifetime prevalence of surgical conditions was 26% (25/96). The most common barrier to access to care was lack of financial resources. Of the 3 deaths reported, 2 were associated with surgery. The mean household interview time was 36 minutes. The greatest challenge was efficient coordination with local team members and government officials.

In Africa, orofacial clefts are underascertained, with little or no surveillance system in most parts for clefts and other birth defects. A Nigerian craniofacial anomalies study, NigeriaCRAN, was established in 2006 to support cleft research specifically for epidemiological studies, treatment outcomes, and studies into etiology and prevention. We pooled data from seven of the largest Smile Train treatment centers in the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria. Data from September 2006 to June 2011 were analyzed and clefts compared between sides and genders using the Fisher exact test. A total of 2197 cases were identified during the study period, with an estimated prevalence rate of 0.5 per 1000. Of the total number of orofacial clefts, 54.4% occur in males and 45.6% in females. There was a significant difference (P = .0001) between unilateral left clefts and unilateral right clefts, and there was a significant difference (P = .0001) between bilateral clefts and clefts on either the left or right side. A significant gender difference (P = .03) was also observed for cleft palate, with more females than males. A total of 103 (4.7%) associated anomalies were identified. There were nine syndromic cleft cases, and 10.4% of the total number of individuals with clefts have an affected relative. The significant difference between unilateral clefts and the gender differences in the proportion of cleft palate only are consistent with the literature.

A.; Bash-Taqi, D.; Hagander, L.; Von Schreeb, J.","Background In low-and middle-income countries, there is a gap between the need for surgery and its equitable provision, and a lack of proxy indicators to estimate this gap. Sierra Leone is a West African country with close to three million children. It is unknown to what extent the surgical needs of these children are met. Aim To describe a nationwide provision of pediatric surgical procedures and to assess pediatric hernia repair as a proxy indicator for the shortage of surgical care in the pediatric population in Sierra Leone. Methods We analyzed results from a nationwide facility survey in Sierra Leone that collected data on surgical procedures from operation and anesthesia logbooks in all facilities performing surgery. We included data on all patients under the age of 16 years undergoing surgery. Primary outcomes were rate and volume of surgical procedures. We calculated the expected number of inguinal hernia in children and estimated the unmet need for hernia repair. Results In 2012, a total of 2381 pediatric surgical procedures were performed in Sierra Leone. The rate of pediatric surgical procedures was 84 per 100,000 children 0-15 years of age. The most common pediatric surgical procedure was hernia repair (18%), corresponding to a rate of 16 per 100,000 children 0-15 years of age. The estimated unmet need for inguinal hernia repair was 88%.

This epidemic is predicted to increase with urbanisation and an aim of the Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce deaths and trauma caused by road accidents. Data available on urban trauma in Sierra Leone is limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of trauma and injury related presentations to the emergency centre (EC) of Connaught Hospital, the principal adult tertiary referral centre in Freetown, Sierra Leone between January and March 2016. Patient demographics are described with mechanism of injury. Additional data on length of stay and surgical procedures were recorded for admissions to the trauma ward. Results: During the 3-month period, a total of 340 patients with injury presented to the EC, accounting for 11.6% of total attendances and 68% of adult surgical admissions. The majority were male (66%) and mean age was 26 years (IQR 15–40). The proportion of trauma presentations were higher in the evening and at weekends and 41% of patients were triaged as emergency or very urgent cases. Road traffic accidents were the most frequent cause of injury (55%) followed by falls (17%) and assaults (14%). Burns were more common in children. Head and lower limbs were the most commonly injured body parts and a minority of patients underwent surgical procedures. Median length of stay for adult patients was 4.5 days (IQR 2–11) and 7 days (IQR 4–14) for children.

We sought to identify the range of pediatric surgery available, the barriers to provision, and level of safety of surgery performed for the entire pediatric population in Zambia. Methods: In cooperation with the Ministry of Health, we validated and adapted a World Health Organization instrument. During onsite visits, the availability of 32 emergency and essential surgical procedures relevant to children was surveyed. The availability of basic World Health Organization surgical safety criteria was determined. Results: A single interviewer visited 103 (95%) of 108 surgical hospitals in Zambia and carried out 495 interviews. An average of 68% of the 32 emergency and essential surgical procedures was available (range 32%-100%). Lack of surgical skill was the primary reason for referral in 72% of procedure types, compared with 24%, 2% and 3% due to lack of equipment, supplies and anesthesia skills, respectively (p < 0.001). Minimum pediatric surgical safety criteria were met by 14% of hospitals. Conclusion: The primary limitation to providing pediatric surgical care in Zambia is lack of surgical skills. Minimum safety standards were met by 14% of hospitals. Efforts to improve pediatric surgery should prioritize teaching surgical skills to expand access and providing safety training, equipment and supplies to increase safety. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Such information is necessary for assessing the impact of such conditions on child health and for setting priorities to improve paediatric surgical care. Methods: Described in the article is a 29-month prospective study of all children aged <15 years who were admitted to a government referral hospital in the Gambia from January 1996 to May 1998. Results: A total of 1726 children were admitted with surgical problems. Surgical patients accounted for 11.3% of paediatric admissions and 34 625 total inpatient days. The most common admission diagnoses were injuries (46.9%), congenital anomalies (24.3%), and infections requiring surgery (14.5%). The diagnoses that accounted for the greatest number of inpatient days were burns (18.8%), osteomyelitis (15.4%), fractures (12.7%), soft tissue injuries (3.9%), and head injuries (3.4%). Gambian children were rarely admitted for appendicitis and never admitted for hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. The leading causes of surgical deaths were burns, congenital anomalies, and injuries other than burns. Discussion: Prevention of childhood injuries and better trauma management, especially at the primary and secondary health care levels, should be the priorities for improving paediatric surgical care in sub-Saharan Africa.

METHODS: A prospective pediatric trauma registry was established at Shoe4Africa Children's Hospital (S4A) in Eldoret, Kenya. All trauma patients over a six-month period were enrolled. Descriptive analyses were completed via SAS 9.4 to uncover patterns of demographics, trauma mechanisms and injuries, as well as outcomes. Implementation was assessed using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: The 425 patients had a median age of 5.14 years (IQR 2.4, 8.7). Average time to care was 267.5 min (IQR 134.0, 625.0).

Various model of surgical mission by foreign experts had existed to combat this menace. The indigenous rotatory model by Cleft & facial deformity foundation is hereby presented. Methods: Carrying out an outreach programme in a rural area begins with the identification of a hospital with optimum facility, followed by effective awareness campaign, then a pre- surgical meeting with the hospital management. Personnel, equipment and materials were mobilised to the site while surgery usually lasted one week. Results: Seventeen outreach programmes were carried out in 10 different hospitals from March 2011 to June 2017. There were 546 orofacial cleft patients, 280 (51.3%) males and 266 (48.7%) females. The age ranged between 1 week to 70years with a mean age ± (SD) of 9.3±11.5. Four hundred and forty eight (82.1%) of the cleft patients were operated. Three hundred and twenty two (59.0%) patients were treated under general anaesthesia while 126 (23.1%) were treated under local anaesthesia. Eight surgeons and 4 anaesthetics were trained during the study period with several local practitioners benefitting from exposure to standard practice. Standard techniques were employed for cheiloplasty and palatoplasty. Minor complications were recorded with one mortality. Conclusion: This model is an effective and efficient way of reaching out to the poor patients with orofacial cleft. Effective mobilization, large volume of safe and quality surgery, easy knowledge transfer and possibility of patient review are some of its advantages. With regular training and funding, it could be an effective way of minimising ignorance and eradicating adult cleft in Nigeria and other developing societies.",2018,NA,Pan African Medical Journal,29,NA,NA,NA,10.11604/pamj.2018.29.109.5092,19107,Bello 2018,NA,Barriers to Care; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations,"Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations","Burden & Outcome, Congenital Malformations",Yes,Yes,No,No,Yes,No,Congenital Malformations,No,No,Yes,No,No,No

The vast majority of burns occur in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A certain standard of surgical and anesthesia care is essential to minimize morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to obtain baseline information on surgical burn care in SSA and to determine how this can be improved. A systematic review (PRISMA) was conducted. Data were extracted regarding patient characteristics, surgical care, dressing techniques and outcome. Forty-seven articles from 12 different countries were included. The mean TBSA was 18.2%. Overall mortality was 12.6%. Of the included patients, 47% underwent an operation. Seventeen studies (36% of included studies) reported on the number of patients with deep burn wounds in their population. In this group, 90% was grafted (reported in 17 studies), 25% was done early (<10 days), and 75% late. In this group, the escharotomy rate was 11% (only shown in 3 studies), the amputation rate was 3% (in 6 studies), and development of contractures 8% (reported in 6 studies). Research on surgical burn care in SSA is scarce and a wide range of surgical treatment strategies was found. We were unable to conclude which treatment protocol, early or delayed excision, was most effective. Future studies should ensure uniform data collection to enable comparison between treatment strategies. To improve burn care, the recently published ISBI guidelines for burns provide a practical tool and national and regional treatment protocols, including training in burn surgery, should be developed.

Within these countries, the burden of pediatric surgical conditions falls heaviest on those in rural areas. The objective of the current study was to evaluate the relationship between rurality, surgical condition and treatment status among a cohort of Ugandan children. METHODS: We identified 2176 children from 2315 households throughout Uganda using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey. Children were randomly selected and were included in the study if they were 18 years of age or younger and had a surgical condition. Location of residence, surgical condition, and treatment status was compared among children. RESULTS: Of the 305 children identified with surgical conditions, 81.9% lived in rural areas. The most prevalent causes of surgical conditions reported among rural and urban children were masses (24.0% and 25.5%, respectively), followed by wounds due to injury (19.6% and 16.4%, respectively).

",NA,NA,NA,Barriers and prospects for skin grafting in burn treatment across African countries,"Bbaale, D.; Mohr, C.; Lindert, J.; Allorto, N.; Mabanza, T.; Katabogama, J. B.; Chamania, S.; Elrod, R.; Boettcher, M.; Elrod, J.","INTRODUCTION: The current standard management of full-thickness or deep dermal burns is early tangential excision and skin grafting. A conservative approach to deep burns without the option of skin grafting results in delayed wound healing, possibly leading to wound infection and is associated with hypertrophic scarring and increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the management and availability to perform skin grafting for burns on the African continent. It also sought to identify challenges and perceived improvements. METHODS: A web-based, structured, closed-formatted, multinational survey was designed to gather information on the current state and availability of skin grafting of burn wounds on the African continent. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions, available in English and French. It was reviewed within the GAP-Burn collaboration network and sent to 271 health care professionals who had participated in a previous study and had initially been recruited by means of the snowball system. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed 84 times (response rate: 31.0%), of which 3 were excluded. Responses originated from 22 African countries. The majority 71 (87.7%) resulted from countries with a low Human Development Index (HDI), 7 (8.6%) from medium HDI countries. Split thickness skin grafting (STSG) is performed in 51 (63.0%) centers. The majority considers STSG to reduce length of stay (72.8%) and improve scarring (54.3%), yet some indicated that STSG is associated with increased risk of donor site infection (8.6%) and severe bleeding (7.4%). Factors preventing increased grafting included lack of equipment and training. CONCLUSION: Skin grafting is not performed in a significant number of hospitals treating burns. The majority of the staff believe that more skin grafting would lead to a better outcome. Advocacy and improved infrastructure, human resources coupled with introduction to well-structured health coverage for all in African countries could help to better access and affordability in burn care.",2024,NA,Burns,50,5,1150-1159,38490835,10.1016/j.burns.2024.02.012,13370,Bbaale 2024,NA,Barriers to Care,Access & Barriers,"Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Burns, Trauma",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Burns,Yes,No,No,No,No,No

This study is the first to explore burn scars in rural communities in Mozambique. This work also validated an innovate burn assessment tool, the Morphological African Scar Contractures Classification (MASCC), used to determine surgical need. METHODS: Using a stratified, population-weighted survey, the team interviewed randomly selected households from September 2012 to June 2013. Three rural districts (Chókwè, Nhamatanda, and Ribáuè) were selected to represent the southern, central and northern regions of the country. Injuries were recorded, documented with photographs, and approach to care was gathered. A panel of residents and surgeons reviewed the burn scar images using both the Vancouver Scar Scale and the MASCC, a validated visual scale that categorizes patients into four categories corresponding to levels of surgical intervention. RESULTS: Of the 6104 survey participants, 6% (n = 370) reported one or more burn injuries. Burn injuries were more common in females (57%) and most often occurred on the extremities. Individuals less than 25 years old had a significantly higher odds of reporting a burn scar compared to people older than 45 years. Based on the MASCC, 12% (n = 42) would benefit from surgery to treat contractures. CONCLUSION: Untreated burn injuries are prevalent in rural Mozambique.

L.","BACKGROUND: Injuries are a leading cause of mortality among children globally, with children in low- and middle-income countries more likely to die if injured compared to children in high-income countries. Timely and high-quality care are essential to reduce injury-related morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVES: This study describes patterns, management, and outcomes of children 0-15 years presenting with unintentional injuries at three district hospitals in rural Rwanda between January 1 and December 31, 2017. METHODS: Using a retrospective cross-sectional study design, we assessed the demographic and clinical characteristics, care provided, and outcomes of the children using data extracted from patient medical charts. We describe the patient population using frequencies and proportions as well as median and interquartile ranges. FINDINGS: Of the 449 injured children who sought care at the three rural district hospitals, 66.2% (n = 297) were boys. The main causes of injury were falls (n = 261, 58.1%), burns (n = 101, 22.5%), and road traffic injuries (n = 67, 14.9%). Burns were the most common injury among children aged 0-5 years while falls were the leading injury type among the 5-15 years age group. Vital signs were inconsistently completed ranging between 23.8-89.1% of vital sign items. Of the injured children, 37.0% (n = 166) received surgery at the district hospital, general practitioners performed 80.9% (n = 114) of surgeries, 87.4% (n = 145) of operated patients received no anesthesia, and 69.3% (n = 311) were admitted to the district hospital, while 2.7% (n = 12) were transferred to tertiary facilities for higher-level care. CONCLUSIONS: The presentation of child injuries-namely falls, burns, and road traffic accidents-is similar to what has been reported in other sub-Saharan African countries. However, more needs to be done to improve the completion and documentation of vital signs and increase availability of surgical specialists. Finally, targeted strategies to prevent burns and motorcycle-related injuries are recommended prevention interventions for this rural population.",2020,NA,Ann Glob Health,86,1,116,32983912,10.5334/aogh.2711,13365,Bagahirwa 2020,NA,Burden; Burns; Injuries; Road Traffic Accidents,"Burden & Outcome, Trauma, Burns","Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Burns, Trauma",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,No,No,Burns; Trauma,Yes,Yes,No,No,No,No

W.; Negussie, A. G.","Introduction: Burn is skin and tissue damage caused by various agents such as fire, scalds, electricity, chemicals, or radiation injuries. Globally, burn injuries pose a substantial public health challenge, with a high risk of mortality and morbidity, accounting for over 310,000 annual deaths. Nearly 75 % of burns in young children result from scald burns and infants have the highest mortality rates. Factors such as large surface area of burn, inhalational injury, poverty, and the presence of sepsis contribute significantly to mortality and morbidity in burns. Objective: To assess the pattern of presentation of pediatric burn injuries and their management outcomes. Methods: A hospital-based retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted. Data were extracted from patient charts, cleaned, coded, checked for completeness, and entered into SPSS version 25 for analysis. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression were used for data analysis, and graphical presentations were utilized to present the result findings. Results: Among the 218 paediatric burn patients admitted to the Addis Ababa Burn, Emergency and Trauma Hospital's burn unit, 71.1 % had sustained scald burns due to hot water splashes, while 20.2 % of the patients were admitted due to flame burns. Superficial partial thickness burns occurred in 53.6 % of the patients, with the upper extremity and trunk being the most commonly affected sites. Approximately 38.2 % of the patients developed acute complications, with sepsis of the wound focus being the most common. Chronic complications occurred in 30.7 % of patients, primarily in the form of post-burn contractures. A mortality rate of 3.2 % was observed during the admission period with 2.3 % of deaths occurring in children under 5 years and those with major burns. Conclusion & Recommendation: The primary causes of burns in the pediatric age group are predominantly preventable scalds.

Objective: To assess clinician- and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) before and after reconstructive surgery for patients with noma in northwest Nigeria. Methods: Objective outcomes were recorded using the noma-specific NOITULP (nose, outer cheek, inner cheek, trismus, upper/lower lip, particularities) classification system. PROs were recorded using a locally developed tool. Postsurgical changes were assessed by Wilcoxon signed-rank testing. Linear regression was used to look for associated risk factors. The inter-rater reliability (IRR) of the NOITULP score was assessed using the weighted kappa statistic. Results: Forty-nine patients (median age 25 years, 71% male) underwent local/regional flap reconstruction and/or trismus release. Twelve complications were reported. Univariate analysis showed a 3.20 change in PRO score (95% confidence interval 0.59 to 5.81, p = 0.018) per kilogram the patient underwent at time of surgery.

Some of the victims of trauma are left with life threatening conditions requiring urgent surgical intervention and/or intensive care. The objectives of this study were to determine the pattern of major trauma needing intensive care in the region, and to determine the outcome of major trauma admitted to intensive care unit. METHODS: A six-year retrospective cohort study of trauma patients needing intensive care, set in the Intensive Care Unit of Ahmadu Bello University Teaching Hospital, Zaria, North-West Nigeria. Subjects were major trauma patients admitted into the intensive care unit of the institution, identified via an admission register kept in the unit. The main outcomes measured were length of stay and mortality. RESULTS: Trauma admissions represented 25.1% of the all intensive care admissions. Severe traumatic brain injury accounted for 32.1% of the trauma admissions, while burns accounted for 23.2%. Of the injuries, 15.5% were sustained in bomb blasts, and 8.3% were firearm injuries. The majority of the patients stayed for no more than seven days from admission. Burns patients had the worst outcomes, with 82.1% mortality. CONCLUSION: Major trauma contributes significantly to local intensive care admissions, with terrorism- related trauma now an emerging challenging cause of major trauma in our region. The observed poor outcomes in this study are a reflection of the quality of available intensive care, and lends credence to the concept of appropriately resourced, specialised intensive care units for optimisation of care.",2019,NA,Afr J Emerg Med,9,Suppl,S32-s37,30976498,10.1016/j.afjem.2018.12.007,15273,Amaefule 2019,"Rachel Wangi (2025-03-25 22:56:02)(Select): burns, trauma;",Burden; Burns; Trauma,"Burden & Outcome, Trauma, Burns","Burden & Outcome, Burns, Trauma",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,No,Trauma,No,Yes,No,No,No,No

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study by reviewing the musculoskeletal (MSK) clinic and community outreach logs for children (age < 18 years) seen at Kumi Hospital in Kumi, Uganda, between January 2013 and December 2015. For each patient, we recorded the age, sex, diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. RESULTS: Of the 4852 children, the most common diagnoses were gluteal and quadriceps contractures (29.4% (95% CI 28.1-30.7%), 96% of which were gluteal fibrosis), post-injection paralysis (12.7% (95% CI 11.8-13.6%)), infection (10.5% (95% CI 9.7-11.4%)), trauma (6.9% (95% CI 6.2-7.6%)), cerebral palsy (6.9% (95% CI 6.2-7.7%)), and clubfoot (4.3% (95% CI 3.8-4.9%)). Gluteal fibrosis, musculoskeletal infections, and angular knee deformities create a large surgical burden with 88.1%, 59.1%, and 54.1% of patients seen with these diagnoses referred for surgery, respectively. Post-injection paralysis, clubfoot, and cerebral palsy were treated non-operatively in over 75% of cases. CONCLUSION: While population-based estimates of disease burden and resource utilization are needed, this data offers insight into burden of musculoskeletal disease for this region of Sub-Saharan Africa. We estimate that 50% of the surgical conditions could be prevented with policy changes and education regarding injection practices and early care for traumatic injuries, clubfeet, and infection.

This study aims to determine the effect of training community members as volunteers for or in the detection and referral of people who have Buruli ulcer to the hospital. Methods: The following study is a before and after study in the BU-endemic Local Government Areas (LGA) of Ebonyi State. A cluster random sampling technique was used to select 90 volunteers from three LGAs (30 from each LGA). In each LGA, the volunteers underwent a one-day training and six months field work to identify all those who have any form of ulcer on any part of their bodies. A short questionnaire was used to capture socio-demographic characteristics of the patient, site of the ulcer, duration of the ulcer, initial appearance of the ulcer, referral to hospital, result of laboratory investigation, and treatment received. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Microsoft Windows version 20 software. The Z test statistic was used to compare the number of referred BU patients before and after the intervention by LGA. The Chi square test was used to examine the association between the dependent and independent variables. Results: The mean age of volunteers was 39 ± 9.5 while mean age of the patients was 42.3 ± 17.1. Most of the ulcers were on the legs (79.4%) and lasted 1–5 years (65.6%). There was a significant increase in the proportion of BU suspects identified by the community volunteers in all 3 LGAs (Afikpo north (p = < 0.001), Abakaliki (p = 0.02), Ikwo (p = 0.001). The duration of the ulcer was associated with the detection and referral of the patients with higher levels of detection and referral among those whose ulcer had lasted 1–5 years in two of the LGAs (P < 0.001). Conclusion: We recommend that program managers and stakeholders integrate and scale up the services of trained community health volunteers for the rapid detection of Buruli ulcer cases in rural endemic communities.

To justify investment in surgical interventions, donors require estimates of the economic benefit of treating surgical disease. The present study aimed to establish a methodology for valuing the potential economic benefit of surgical intervention using cleft lip and palate (CLP) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a model. METHODS: Economic modeling of cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP) in SSA was performed with retrospective demographic and economic data from 2008. The total number of Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) secondary to CLP in 2008 was calculated from accepted clefting incidence rates and disability weights taken from the Global Burden of Disease Project. DALYs were then converted to monetary terms ($US), using both a human capital approach and Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) approach. RESULTS: With the human capital approach, the potential economic benefit if all incident cases of CLP in SSA in 2008 were repaired at birth ranged from $252 million to $441 million. With VSL, the potential economic benefit of the same CLP repair would range from $5.4 billion to $9.7 billion.

Surgical disease has been estimated to constitute 11% of the total global burden of disease, of which a substantial fraction unfortunately remains unmet in resource limited area. Surgical volume is large and continues to grow in all economic environments, yet many low-income countries fail to achieve basic levels of surgical service. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of emergency and essential surgical service in primary hospital facilities of south Gondar zone in Amhara regional state. Design: A cross sectional survey was employed in seven primary hospitals of south Gondar zone. Material: The WHO tool for situational analysis to assess emergency and essential surgical care was employed to capture a health facility's capacity to perform basic surgical (including obstetrics and trauma) and anesthesia interventions by investigating four categories of data: infrastructure, human resources, interventions available and equipment. The tool queried the availability of eight types of care providers, 35 surgical interventions and 67 items of equipment. Result: Of the 35 basic interventions listed in the tool, 51.4% basic interventions including caesarean section were available at all facilities. Averaging of 51 beds per facility was reported. The mean distance travelled prior to admission was 42 km. A total of 170 healthcare providers were reported in the seven facilities. This survey found that essential equipment was not consistently available at all of the facilities. Conclusion: Discrepancies in infrastructure, human resources, service provision, and essential equipment and supplies demonstrate the significant gaps in capacity of hospitals to deliver emergency and essential surgical care and effectively addressing the increasing surgical burden of disease and injury in south Gondar zone primary hospitals.

Burn injuries are a global public health problem, accounting for an estimated 265,000 deaths. Globally, over half of the disability-adjusted life years lost from fire-related burns which occurred between the ages of 0 and 14 years. The rate of child deaths from burns is currently over 7 times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries. In Ethiopia, burn was the second leading cause of death among children from the unintentional injuries. So far, no research had been conducted in terms of assessing the outcome of burn injury in children in Ethiopia and particularly in Tigray region. The aim of this study was to assess the outcome of burn injury and associated factors among hospitalized children of under 18 years at Ayder Referral Hospital in Mekelle, Ethiopia. Method. A retrospective document review was used to assess the outcome of burn injury and associated factors in Ayder Referral Hospital. A total of 382 hospitalized children's chart from 2011 to 2015 were reviewed using a structured check list. To select the patients' chart, a simple random sampling technique was used and a sampling frame was prepared based on a registration book. Data was entered, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS version 20. Result. Almost 70% of the burns were caused by scald, and 45.3% of the burns were confined to the upper extremities. Eighty-two percent of the patients were discharged without complication. Lack of fluid resuscitation within 24 hours (AOR=2.767; 95% CI (1.276-5.999)) and a burn patient with malnutrition (AOR=0.252; 95% CI (0.069-0.923)) were statically significant with the outcome of burn injury. Conclusion. Majority of the pediatric burn patients were discharged without complication. The most causative agent of these accidents was scald; upper extremities also were the most affected area. The factors associated with the outcome of burn injury according to this study were lack of fluid resuscitation and malnourishment of burn patients.",2020,NA,International Journal of Pediatrics (United Kingdom),2020,NA,NA,NA,10.1155/2020/9136256,18195,Alemayehu 2020,NA,Burden; Burns,"Burden & Outcome, Burns","Burden & Outcome, Burns, Trauma",Yes,No,Yes,Yes,No,Yes,Burns,Yes,No,No,No,No,No

We partnered with the Ministry of Health to conduct a nationwide mixed-methods evaluation of private and PNFP surgical capacity in Uganda. Methods A standardized validated facility assessment tool was utilized to assess facility infrastructure, service delivery, workforce, information management, and financing at a randomized nationally representative sample of 16 private and PNFP hospitals. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to qualitatively explore facilitating factors and barriers to surgical, obstetric and anaesthesia (SOA) care. Hospitals walk-throughs and retrospective reviews of operative logbooks were completed. Results Hospitals had a median of 177 beds and two operating rooms. Ten hospitals (62.5%) were able to perform all Bellwether procedures (cesarean section, laparotomy and open fracture treatment). Thirty-day surgical volume averaged 102 cases per facility. While most hospitals had electricity, oxygen, running water, and necessary equipment, many reported pervasive shortages of blood, surgical consumables, and anesthetic drugs. Several themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: (1) geographic distance and limited transportation options delay reaching care; (2) workforce shortages impede the delivery of surgical care; (3) emergency and obstetric volume overwhelm the surgical system; (4) medical and non-medical costs delay seeking, reaching, and receiving care; and (5) there is poor coordination of care with insufficient support systems. Conclusion As in Uganda's public sector, barriers to surgery in private and PNFP hospitals in Uganda are cross-cutting and closely tied to resource availability.

Few studies, particularly in resource-limited settings, have described factors associated with outcomes after these fractures. Questions/purposes (1) Which patient demographic, perioperative, and treatment characteristics are associated with an increased risk of reoperation after treatment of open tibia fractures with intramedullary nailing or an external fixation device in Tanzania? (2) Which patient demographic, perioperative, and treatment characteristics are associated with worse 1-year quality of life after treatment of open tibia fractures with intramedullary nailing or an external fixation device in Tanzania? Methods A prospective study was completed in parallel to a similarly conducted RCT at a tertiary referral center in Tanzania that enrolled adult patients with diaphyseal open tibia fractures from December 2015 to March 2017. Patients were treated with either a statically locked intramedullary nail or external fixator and examined at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. The primary outcome, reoperation, was any deep infection or nonunion treated with a secondary intervention. The secondary outcome was the 1-year EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) index score. There were 394 patients screened and ultimately, 267 patients enrolled in the study (240 from the primary RCT and 27 followed for the purposes of this study). Of these, 90% (240 of 267) completed 1-year follow-up and were included in the final analysis. This group comprised 110 patients who underwent IMN and 130 who had external fixation; follow-up was similar between study groups. Patients were an average of 33 years old and were primarily males who sustained road traffic injuries resulting in AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) classification type A or B fractures. There were 51 reoperations. For the purposes of analysis, all patients were pooled to identify all other factors, in addition to treatment type, associated with increased risk of reoperation and 1-year quality of life. An exploratory bivariable analysis identifying various factors associated with reoperation risk and EQ-5D was subsequently included in a multivariate modeling procedure to control for confounding of effect on our primary outcome. Multivariable modeling was performed using standard hierarchical modeling simplification procedures with log-likelihood ratios. Alpha levels were set to 0.05. Results After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as gender, smoking status, mechanism of injury, and treatment type, the following factors were independently associated with reoperation: Time from hospital presentation to surgery more than 24 hours (odds ratio 7.7 [95% confidence interval 2.1 to 27.8; p = 0.002), AO/OTA fracture classification Type 42C fracture (OR 4.2 [95% CI 1.2 to 14.0]; p = 0.02), OTA-Open Fracture Classification muscle loss (OR 7.5 [95% CI 1.3 to 42.2]; p = 0.02), and varus coronal angle on an immediate postoperative AP radiograph (OR 4.8 [95% CI 1.2 to 14.0]; p = 0.002). After again controlling for confounding variables such as gender, smoking status, mechanism of injury, and treatment type factors independently associated with worse 1-year EQ-5D scores included: Wound length >= 10 cm (ss = [change in EQ-5D score] -0.081 [95% CI -0.139 to -0.023]; p = 0.006), OTA-Open Fracture Classification muscle loss (ss = -0.133 [95% CI -0.215 to -0.051]; p = 0.002), and OTA-Open Fracture Classification bone loss (ss = -0.111 [95% CI -0.208 to -0. 013]; p = 0.03). We observed a modest, but independent association between reoperation and worse 1-year EQ-5D scores (ss = -0.113 [95% CI -0.150 to -0.077]; p < 0.001). Conclusions We found two potentially modifiable factors associated with the risk of reoperation: reducing time to surgical treatment and avoiding varus coronal angulation during definitive stabilization. Hospitals may be able to minimize time to surgery, and thus, reoperation, by increasing the number of available operative personnel and space and emphasizing the importance of open tibia fractures as an injury requiring emergent orthopaedic management. Given the lack of fluoroscopy in the study setting and similar settings, surgeons should emphasize appropriate fracture alignment, even into slight valgus, to avoid varus angulation and subsequent reoperation risk.",2020,NA,Clin.

The current status of burn care, the lack of infrastructure, and traditional methods of treatment, further contribute to the unsatisfactory status of overall burn management, prevention, and rehabilitation of burn survivors. A strategy for improving burn care in Africa has been formulated. The management of childhood burns will only be successful if educational, social, fiscal and infrastructure standards are improved.

Z.; Kobusingye, O. C.; Bekele, A.; Riviello, R. R.","Purpose of Review Sub-Saharan Africa is a diverse context with a large burden of injury and trauma-related deaths. Relative to high-income contexts, most of the region is less mature in prehospital and facility-based trauma care, education and training, and trauma care quality assurance. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes rising inequalities, both within and between countries as a deterrent to growth and development. While disparities in access to trauma care between the region and HICs are more commonly described, internal disparities are equally concerning. We performed a narrative review of internal disparities in trauma care access using a previously described conceptual model. Recent Findings A broad PubMed and EMBASE search from 2010 to 2021 restricted to 48 sub-Saharan African countries was performed. Records focused on disparities in access to trauma care were identified and mapped to de Jager's four component framework. Search findings, input from contextual experts, comparisons based on other related research, and disaggregation of data helped inform the narrative. Only 21 studies were identified by formal search, with most focused on urban versus rural disparities in geographical access to trauma care. An additional 6 records were identified through citation searches and experts. Disparity in access to trauma care providers, detection of indications for trauma surgery, progression to trauma surgery, and quality care provision were thematically analyzed. No specific data on disparities in access to injury care for all four domains was available for more than half of the countries. From available data, socioeconomic status, geographical location, insurance, gender, and age were recognized disparity domains. South Africa has the most mature trauma systems. Across the region, high quality trauma care access is skewed towards the urban, insured, higher socioeconomic class adult. District hospitals are more poorly equipped and manned, and dedicated trauma centers, blood banks, and intensive care facilities are largely located within cities and in southern Africa. The largest geographical gaps in trauma care are presumably in central Africa, francophone West Africa, and conflict regions of East Africa. Disparities in trauma training opportunities, public-private disparities in provider availability, injury care provider migration, and several other factors contribute to this inequity. National trauma registries will play a role in internal inequity monitoring, and deliberate development implementation of National Surgical, Obstetrics, and Anesthesia plans will help address disparities. Human, systemic, and historical factors supporting these disparities including implicit and explicit bias must be clearly identified and addressed. Systems approaches, strategic trauma policy frameworks, and global and regional coalitions, as modelled by the Global Alliance for Care of the Injured and the Bellagio group, are key. Inequity in access can be reduced by prehospital initiatives, as used in Ghana, and community-based insurance, as modelled by Rwanda. Summary Sub-Saharan African countries have underdeveloped trauma systems. Consistent in the narrative is the rural-urban disparity in trauma care access and the disadvantage of the poor. Further research is needed in view of data disparity. Recognition of these disparities should drive creative equitable solutions and focused interventions, partnerships, accompaniment, and action.",2022,NA,Curr.

M.; Weidman, V.; Nordin, P.; Wladis, A.; Löfgren, J.","BACKGROUND: The role of surgery in global health has gained greater attention in recent years. Approximately 1.8 billion children below 15 years live in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Many surgical conditions affect children. Therefore, paediatric surgery requires specific emphasis. Left unattended, the consequences can be dire. Despite this, there is a paucity of data regarding prevalence of surgical conditions in children in LMIC. The present objective was to investigate the prevalence of paediatric surgical conditions in children in a defined geographical area in Eastern Uganda. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site located in Eastern Uganda. Through a two-stage, cluster-based sampling process, 490 households from 49 villages were randomly selected, generating a study population of 1581 children. The children's caregivers were interviewed, and the children were physically examined by two medical doctors to identify any surgical conditions. RESULTS: The interview was performed with 1581 children, and 1054 were physically examined. Among these, the overall prevalence of any surgical condition was 16.0 per cent (n = 169). Of these, 39 per cent had an unmet surgical need (66 of 169). This is equivalent to a 6.3 per cent prevalence of current unmet surgical need. The most common groups of surgical condition were congenital anomalies and trauma-related conditions. CONCLUSION: Surgical conditions in children are common in eastern Uganda. The unmet need for surgery is high. With a growing population, the need for paediatric surgical capacity will increase even further.

Objective: This study aimed to describe the pattern and outcome of paediatric surgical cases operated upon in a newly established paediatric surgical unit in Nigeria. Subjects and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of all subjects that were operated upon by the paediatric surgery unit over a 28-month period. Data obtained included age, sex, diagnosis, timing of surgery, post-treatment complications and outcome. Diagnoses were categorised based on the International Classification of Diseases 11th revision for morbidity and mortality statistics. Data analysis was done using Stata version 12. Results: A total of 377 procedures were performed on 336 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 2.1:1. The median age at surgery was 36 months. Disorders of the digestive system (184, 48.8%) and developmental anomalies (119, 31.6%) accounted for majority of the cases, with inguinal hernias and hydrocoeles accounting for 17.0% of all cases. Thirty-six per cent of the procedures were emergent ones, and the overall complication rate was 23.6% (89/377). The unplanned re-operation rate was 7.4% (25/336) and mortality rate was 5.1% (17/336). Typhoid ileal perforation was responsible for 4 (23.5%) of the deaths.

A follow-up survey after the introduction of the psychosocial approach recorded fewer (85) new Buruli ulcer (BU) cases of which, the majority (78.8%, 67) were nodules and only 21.2% (18) were ulcers. Health education plays a major role in the holistic treatment of BU.

Aim: To compile burns patients' information in the new Burns Intensive Care Unit (BICU), analyze it and draw comparisons to information from the old BICU at KATH. Methods: This retrospective study involves data from May 2007 to April 2009 (Group 1-old BICU) and May 2009 to April 2011 (Group 2-new BICU). The parameters of burn patients recorded included: record of admission, gender, age, aetiology of injury, Total Burns Surface Area (TBSA), the patients' treatment regime and record of discharge/death. This information was analyzed with SPSS version 18.0. Results: The total number of patients in the study was 511; Group 1 constituted 47.36% (n = 242) patients; males (n = 307, 61%) outnumbering females (n = 204, 39%). The overall mean, median and interquartile range (IQR) ages of the patients were 12.4 ± 2; 9.5 and 18.0 years respectively. The main aetiology of burns in Group 1 was flame burns (n = 115, 47.5%) and for Group 2 was scald (n = 151, 56.1%). The median TBSA recorded for Groups 1 and 2 were 32% and 41% respectively. A mortality rate of 19.1% (n = 46) and 12.7% (n = 34) were recorded for Groups 1 and 2 respectively which was statistically significant (p < 0.05). We found no differences for age and TBSA (P = 0.7168 and P = 0.8020 respectively). A Chi Square analysis for gender and aetiology of burn revealed no significant difference between Groups 1 and 2. A risk factor analysis for mortality within the Groups (using multiple regression analysis) identified only aetiology of burn in Group 1 to be a factor (P = 0.044). Conclusion: This comparative study reveals that a significant difference in mortality was recorded for both groups. The mortality difference does not appear to be due to socio-demographic features.

This study assessed the factors influencing delayed access to essential surgical care in Uganda. Methods: A descriptive multi-center cross-sectional survey was carried out in three hospitals designated for major surgeries in Uganda from December 2019 to December 2021 across three regions of the country in a prospective manner. Patients admitted to the hospitals that required surgical intervention were included. Bivariate analysis using the chi-square test or Fischers’ exact test and multivariable logistic regression models to adjust for confounders were carried out. Findings: A total of 635 patients participated in the study of which the majority were males (n = 399, 63%) from the Northern region (n = 347, 54.7%.). Most patients and sought surgical help immediately (n = 406, 63.9%) and were operated on time (n = 402, 63.3%), however only 23.3% (n = 148) were able to reach the hospital for care on time.

Methods: Survey questionnaires were administered to practitioners attending the second Pan-African Congress on Cleft Lip and Palate (PACCLIP), which took place in Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa from February 4-7, 2007. The conference included 225 participants, representing 17 African countries. Results: Protocols for repair of cleft lip and palate deformities were varied, with Millard's and von Langenbeck's techniques being the preferred approach for the management of cleft lip and palate deformities, respectively. A large proportion of providers have limited access to core cleft care supporting teams, especially speech language pathologists, orthodontists, and audiologists. Several challenging barriers to cleft care were also identified at both the institutional and individual levels and are reported. Conclusion: Geographic separation in Africa presents a similar challenge due to isolationism as it does to surgeons in Europe. Specific to Africa are the increased barriers to care, and economic and financial hardship at various levels.

O.; Goodness Adefokun, I.; Uwale Eyesan, S.","Background: Trauma is now one of the fastest growing epidemics globally but low and middle-income countries (LMICs) are more severely affected in terms of cost, disability and death. The high-energy trauma of road traffic accidents and violence often produces open fractures which can be difficult to manage in resource-poor settings. Adequate stabilization, such as provided by locked nails, has been found to ensure better outcome for open fractures. There is dearth of published studies on the use of locked intramedullary nail in the treatment of open fractures in Nigeria. Methods: This is a prospective observational study of all the 101 open fractures of the humerus, femur and tibia treated over a period of 92 months with Surgical Implant Generation Network (SIGN) nail. Fracture severity was classified according to the modified Gustilo-Anderson system. The intervals between fracture and antibiotics administration, débridement and definitive fixation, as well as surgery duration and method of fracture reduction were noted. Outcomes measured at follow-up included infection, ongoing radiographic healing, knee flexion/shoulder abduction beyond ninety degrees (KF/SA > 900), full weight bearing (FWB), painless squatting (PS&S)/shoulder abduction-external rotation (SAER). Results: Most of the patients fall between ages 20 and 49 years; 75.5% of them were males. There were more Gustilo-Anderson type IIIA fractures than other types but nine type IIIB tibia fractures were also nailed. The overall infection rate was 15%, contributed mostly by the type IIIB fractures. By the 12th post-operative week, at least 79% had ongoing radiographic healing and had achieved all of KF/SA > 900, FWB, and PS&S/SAER.

T.; Ajike, S. O.; Abite, M. G.","Background: The worldwide pattern of oral and maxillofacial surgical conditions has been rarely reported despite its significance in head and neck medicine. The Niger Delta region comprises 9 of the 36 states in the Federal Republic of Nigeria. There are scanty reports on oral and maxillofacial surgical diseases from the region despite its 95% contribution to Nigeria's oil-revenue. Methods: This retrospective survey of oral/maxillofacial surgical cases seen at a referral center in Port Harcourt, a city in the Niger delta region of Nigeria. Results: Between 2000 and 2004, our center offered specialized maxillofacial surgical services to 86 patients coming from 5 states in the Niger delta region. These patients made up 20% of all patients seen at the department within the period. There were 110 indications for surgical interventions. Most were complaints of trauma (46.4%). The rest were tumors and allied lesions (39.0%) and cysts (12.7%). Ratio of male to female patients was 1.7:1 while patients were aged between 9 and 85years (mean 31.2years, standard deviation ±15.4). Most (n = 63, 73%) had surgical treatment while a significant proportion (19%) defaulted. Seventy -nine surgical procedures were performed (69 primary and 10 secondary). Primary procedures included maxillo-mandibular fixation (31.9%) and enucleation of tumor/cyst (17.4%). While our series of 86 cases over 4years appears low, there is likelihood that oral and maxillofacial surgical conditions are as common in the Niger Delta region as in other parts of Nigeria. There is scarcity of skilled manpower and equipments for the management of oral maxillofacial surgical conditions in the region. Health promotion activities are needed to improve awareness for early diagnosis of these conditions. Also, poverty alleviation measures need to be effective as defaults were often due to inability to pay for treatment. Conclusion: In many parts of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria, oral and maxillofacial surgical diseases are not uncommon causes of morbidity. However, many parts of the region lack requisite manpower for prevention and curative health activities. Defaults from hospital treatment were due to preference for traditional (unorthodox) measures and financial inability.

D.; van Duinen, A. J.; Grimes, C. E.; Hampaye, T. C.; Quaife, M.; Bolkan, H. A.","OBJECTIVES: The economic consequences of untreated surgical disease are potentially large. The aim of this study was to estimate the economic burden associated with unmet surgical needs in Liberia. DESIGN: A nationwide enumeration of surgical procedures and providers was conducted in Liberia in 2018. We estimated the number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) saved by operative activities and converted these into economic losses averted using gross national income per capita and value of a statistical life (VSL) approaches. The total, the met and the unmet needs for surgery were determined, and economic losses caused by unmet surgical needs were estimated. Finally, we valued the economic losses avoided by various surgical provider groups. RESULTS: A total of 55 890 DALYs were averted by surgical activities in 2018; these activities prevented an economic loss of between US$35 and US$141 million. About half of these values were generated by the non-specialist physician workforce. Furthermore, a non-specialist physician working a full-time position for 1 year prevented an economic loss of US$717 069 using the VSL approach, while a specialist resident and a certified specialist saved US$726 606 and US$698 877, respectively. The burden of unmet surgical need was associated with productivity losses of between US$388 million and US$1.6 billion; these losses equate to 11% and 46% of the annual gross domestic product for Liberia. CONCLUSION: The economic burden of untreated surgical disease is large in Liberia.

The aim of this study was to assess the surgical outcome of cleft lip and palate surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The surgical outcome of 131 consecutive patients with cleft lip and palate surgeries between October 2008 and December 2010 were prospectively evaluated at least 4 weeks postoperatively. Data collected included information about the age, sex, type of cleft defects, and type of surgery performed as well as postoperative complications. For cleft lip repair, the Pennsylvania lip and nose (PLAN) score was used to assess the surgical outcome, while the integrity of the closure was used for cleft palate repair. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients had cleft lip repair and 64 had palate repair. Overall, 68.8% cases of cleft lip and palate repair had good outcomes; 67.9% of lip repairs had good lip and nose scores, while 70.2% of palatal repair had a good surgical outcome.
