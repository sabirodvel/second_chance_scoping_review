Surgical outcome and complications following cleft lip and palate repair in a teaching hospital in Nigeria,"Abdurrazaq, T. O.; Micheal, A. O.; Lanre, A. W.; Olugbenga, O. M.; Akin, L. L.","BACKGROUND: Measurement of treatment outcome is important in estimating the success of cleft management. The aim of this study was to assess the surgical outcome of cleft lip and palate surgery. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The surgical outcome of 131 consecutive patients with cleft lip and palate surgeries between October 2008 and December 2010 were prospectively evaluated at least 4 weeks postoperatively. Data collected included information about the age, sex, type of cleft defects, and type of surgery performed as well as postoperative complications. For cleft lip repair, the Pennsylvania lip and nose (PLAN) score was used to assess the surgical outcome, while the integrity of the closure was used for cleft palate repair. RESULTS: A total of 92 patients had cleft lip repair and 64 had palate repair. Overall, 68.8% cases of cleft lip and palate repair had good outcomes; 67.9% of lip repairs had good lip and nose scores, while 70.2% of palatal repair had a good surgical outcome. Oro-fistula was observed in 29.8% of cleft palate repairs Inter-rater reliability coefficient was substantially significant. CONCLUSIONS: The fact that 25.7% of those treated were aged >1 year suggests a continued need to enlighten the public on the availability of cleft lip and palate expertise and treatment. Although an overall good treatment outcome was demonstrated in this study, the nasal score was poorer than the lip score. Complication rate of about 14% following surgical repair is consistent with previous reports in the literature.",2013,NA,Afr J Paediatr Surg,10,4,345-57,24469486,10.4103/0189-6725.125447,13671,#137,Abdurrazaq 2013,NA,Cleft Palate,Congenital Malformations,Access & Barriers,Yes
Rotational rural surgery for the poor in developing countries,"Aderounmu, A. O. A.; Afolayan, S. A.; Nasiru, T. A.; Olaore, J. A.; Adeoti, M. L.; Adelasoye, M.","Radio and television announcements advised patients with surgical problems in the rural areas of Osun State, Nigeria, to report at any of the nine zonal headquarters of the state which were closest to their homes in order to receive free treatment. Over 1000 patients reported and 801 received operations on a rotational basis within nine weeks. We studied 719 of these patients, ages between 4 months and 87 years, who had detailed follow-up records. There were 14 different procedures ranging from a hernia repair to the separation of syndactyly. Complications included postoperative pain, haematoma and late superficial wound infection.

Africa has unique and urgent barriers to cleft care: Lessons from practitioners at the pan-african congress on cleft lip and palate,"Adetayo, O.; Ford, R.; Martin, M.","Background: The goals of this study were to delineate the protocols employed for managing patients with cleft lip and palate deformities, delineate the challenges facing practitioners and patients, and to determine the patient and physician barriers to cleft care delivery in the region. Methods: Survey questionnaires were administered to practitioners attending the second Pan-African Congress on Cleft Lip and Palate (PACCLIP), which took place in Ibadan, Nigeria, West Africa from February 4-7, 2007. The conference included 225 participants, representing 17 African countries. Results: Protocols for repair of cleft lip and palate deformities were varied, with Millard's and von Langenbeck's techniques being the preferred approach for the management of cleft lip and palate deformities, respectively. A large proportion of providers have limited access to core cleft care supporting teams, especially speech language pathologists, orthodontists, and audiologists. Several challenging barriers to cleft care were also identified at both the institutional and individual levels and are reported. Conclusion: Geographic separation in Africa presents a similar challenge due to isolationism as it does to surgeons in Europe. Specific to Africa are the increased barriers to care, and economic and financial hardship at various levels. A focus on funding, team building, infrastructural support, and patient education appear to be crucial in improving the care and lives of children with facial clefts in Africa. © Oluwaseun Adetayo et al.",2012,NA,Pan African Medical Journal,12,1,NA,NA,NA,21134,#306,Adetayo 2012,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-30 01:45:51)(Select): constraints and barriers to cleft care encountered by practitioners;,Barriers to Care; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations,Access & Barriers,Access & Barriers,Yes
"Factors enhancing the control of Buruli ulcer in the Bomfa communities, Ghana","Agbenorku, P.; Agbenorku, M.; Amankwa, A.; Tuuli, L.; Saunderson, P.","This study examines factors that may enhance the control and holistic treatment of Buruli ulcer in an endemic area of the Ashanti Region in Ghana. A total of 189 Buruli ulcer patients from the Bomfa sub-district were treated at the Global Evangelical Mission Hospital, Apromase - Ashanti, Ghana, from January to December 2005. Diagnosis was based on clinical findings and confirmed by any two positives of Ziehl-Neelson test for acid fast bacilli, polymerase chain reaction and histopathology. Children up to age 14 made up 43.4% of the cases; male: female ratio was 3:2. The mean duration of hospitalization was 77 days and hospital stay was significantly correlated with the time spent at home with the disease prior to admission; also, 76.7% of the cases were late ulcers. Of the 189 patients, 145 (i.e. 76.7%) were treated with antibiotics and surgery which involved excision, skin grafting with or without contracture release. A follow-up survey after the introduction of the psychosocial approach recorded fewer (85) new Buruli ulcer (BU) cases of which, the majority (78.8%, 67) were nodules and only 21.2% (18) were ulcers.

"A new era in the management of burns trauma in kumasi, ghana","Agbenorku, P.; Akpaloo, J.; Yalley, D.; Appiah, A.","The aim of the study was to investigate the factors affecting the outcome of treatment of burns patients admitted to the Burns Intensive Care Unit (BICU) of the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, Kumasi, Ghana. Information on patients admitted to the BICU from February 2001 to January 2006 was recorded. Parameters recorded included: admission record and demographics, causes of the injury, burned surface area, laboratory investigations, treatment regime, and record of discharge/death. The data were analysed with SPSS version 12.0 and Spearman's rank correlation. A total of 826 patients were recorded; males (n = 492, 60%) outnumbered females (n= 334, 40%). The mean age was 10.5 ± 5 yr, the majority (n = 441, 53%) in the range 0-10 yr. Flame burns (n = 587, 71%), scalds (n = 209, 25%), and chemicals (n = 19, 2%) were the three significant causes of burn injuries. The mean range of the total body surface area (TBSA) burned was 11-20%; 94% (n = 775) had up to 60% TBSA; 64% (n = 527) had only wound dressings for treatment; 21% (n = 174) had early excision with skin grafting, while 15% (n = 125) had delayed excision with skin grafting.

Spectrum of paediatric surgical cases in a private mission teaching hospital in Nigeria,"Ajao, A. E.; Adeniran, J. O.","Introduction: Establishing the nature of conditions requiring surgery among children in a particular location may be crucial for policy formulation and implementation as regards paediatric surgery. Objective: This study aimed to describe the pattern and outcome of paediatric surgical cases operated upon in a newly established paediatric surgical unit in Nigeria. Subjects and Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of all subjects that were operated upon by the paediatric surgery unit over a 28-month period. Data obtained included age, sex, diagnosis, timing of surgery, post-treatment complications and outcome. Diagnoses were categorised based on the International Classification of Diseases 11th revision for morbidity and mortality statistics. Data analysis was done using Stata version 12. Results: A total of 377 procedures were performed on 336 patients with a male-to-female ratio of 2.1:1. The median age at surgery was 36 months. Disorders of the digestive system (184, 48.8%) and developmental anomalies (119, 31.6%) accounted for majority of the cases, with inguinal hernias and hydrocoeles accounting for 17.0% of all cases. Thirty-six per cent of the procedures were emergent ones, and the overall complication rate was 23.6% (89/377). The unplanned re-operation rate was 7.4% (25/336) and mortality rate was 5.1% (17/336). Typhoid ileal perforation was responsible for 4 (23.5%) of the deaths.

Prevalence of Paediatric Surgical Conditions in Eastern Uganda: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Ajiko, M. M.; Weidman, V.; Nordin, P.; Wladis, A.; Löfgren, J.","BACKGROUND: The role of surgery in global health has gained greater attention in recent years. Approximately 1.8 billion children below 15 years live in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC). Many surgical conditions affect children. Therefore, paediatric surgery requires specific emphasis. Left unattended, the consequences can be dire. Despite this, there is a paucity of data regarding prevalence of surgical conditions in children in LMIC. The present objective was to investigate the prevalence of paediatric surgical conditions in children in a defined geographical area in Eastern Uganda. METHOD: A cross-sectional study was carried out in the Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site located in Eastern Uganda. Through a two-stage, cluster-based sampling process, 490 households from 49 villages were randomly selected, generating a study population of 1581 children. The children's caregivers were interviewed, and the children were physically examined by two medical doctors to identify any surgical conditions. RESULTS: The interview was performed with 1581 children, and 1054 were physically examined. Among these, the overall prevalence of any surgical condition was 16.0 per cent (n = 169). Of these, 39 per cent had an unmet surgical need (66 of 169). This is equivalent to a 6.3 per cent prevalence of current unmet surgical need. The most common groups of surgical condition were congenital anomalies and trauma-related conditions. CONCLUSION: Surgical conditions in children are common in eastern Uganda. The unmet need for surgery is high. With a growing population, the need for paediatric surgical capacity will increase even further.

Delays to Surgery and Coronal Malalignment Are Associated with Reoperation after Open Tibia Fractures in Tanzania,"Albright, P. D.; Ali, S. H.; Jackson, H.; Haonga, B. T.; Eliezer, E. N.; Morshed, S.; Shearer, D. W.","Background Treatment of diaphyseal open tibia fractures often results in reoperation and impaired quality of life. Few studies, particularly in resource-limited settings, have described factors associated with outcomes after these fractures. Questions/purposes (1) Which patient demographic, perioperative, and treatment characteristics are associated with an increased risk of reoperation after treatment of open tibia fractures with intramedullary nailing or an external fixation device in Tanzania? (2) Which patient demographic, perioperative, and treatment characteristics are associated with worse 1-year quality of life after treatment of open tibia fractures with intramedullary nailing or an external fixation device in Tanzania? Methods A prospective study was completed in parallel to a similarly conducted RCT at a tertiary referral center in Tanzania that enrolled adult patients with diaphyseal open tibia fractures from December 2015 to March 2017. Patients were treated with either a statically locked intramedullary nail or external fixator and examined at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. The primary outcome, reoperation, was any deep infection or nonunion treated with a secondary intervention. The secondary outcome was the 1-year EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) index score. There were 394 patients screened and ultimately, 267 patients enrolled in the study (240 from the primary RCT and 27 followed for the purposes of this study). Of these, 90% (240 of 267) completed 1-year follow-up and were included in the final analysis. This group comprised 110 patients who underwent IMN and 130 who had external fixation; follow-up was similar between study groups. Patients were an average of 33 years old and were primarily males who sustained road traffic injuries resulting in AO/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (OTA) classification type A or B fractures. There were 51 reoperations. For the purposes of analysis, all patients were pooled to identify all other factors, in addition to treatment type, associated with increased risk of reoperation and 1-year quality of life. An exploratory bivariable analysis identifying various factors associated with reoperation risk and EQ-5D was subsequently included in a multivariate modeling procedure to control for confounding of effect on our primary outcome. Multivariable modeling was performed using standard hierarchical modeling simplification procedures with log-likelihood ratios. Alpha levels were set to 0.05. Results After controlling for potentially confounding variables such as gender, smoking status, mechanism of injury, and treatment type, the following factors were independently associated with reoperation: Time from hospital presentation to surgery more than 24 hours (odds ratio 7.7 [95% confidence interval 2.1 to 27.8; p = 0.002), AO/OTA fracture classification Type 42C fracture (OR 4.2 [95% CI 1.2 to 14.0]; p = 0.02), OTA-Open Fracture Classification muscle loss (OR 7.5 [95% CI 1.3 to 42.2]; p = 0.02), and varus coronal angle on an immediate postoperative AP radiograph (OR 4.8 [95% CI 1.2 to 14.0]; p = 0.002). After again controlling for confounding variables such as gender, smoking status, mechanism of injury, and treatment type factors independently associated with worse 1-year EQ-5D scores included: Wound length >= 10 cm (ss = [change in EQ-5D score] -0.081 [95% CI -0.139 to -0.023]; p = 0.006), OTA-Open Fracture Classification muscle loss (ss = -0.133 [95% CI -0.215 to -0.051]; p = 0.002), and OTA-Open Fracture Classification bone loss (ss = -0.111 [95% CI -0.208 to -0. 013]; p = 0.03). We observed a modest, but independent association between reoperation and worse 1-year EQ-5D scores (ss = -0.113 [95% CI -0.150 to -0.077]; p < 0.001). Conclusions We found two potentially modifiable factors associated with the risk of reoperation: reducing time to surgical treatment and avoiding varus coronal angulation during definitive stabilization. Hospitals may be able to minimize time to surgery, and thus, reoperation, by increasing the number of available operative personnel and space and emphasizing the importance of open tibia fractures as an injury requiring emergent orthopaedic management. Given the lack of fluoroscopy in the study setting and similar settings, surgeons should emphasize appropriate fracture alignment, even into slight valgus, to avoid varus angulation and subsequent reoperation risk.",2020,NA,Clin.

"Assessment of emergency and essential surgical service in primary hospitals of South Gondar zone, Amhara region, Ethiopia, 2019","Alemayehu, T. Y.; Boled, A. T.; Taye, M. G.; Kibret, S.; Habtie, M. F.","Introduction: Surgical service at the first level referral hospitals are an important aspect of comprehensive health care. Surgical disease has been estimated to constitute 11% of the total global burden of disease, of which a substantial fraction unfortunately remains unmet in resource limited area. Surgical volume is large and continues to grow in all economic environments, yet many low-income countries fail to achieve basic levels of surgical service. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of emergency and essential surgical service in primary hospital facilities of south Gondar zone in Amhara regional state. Design: A cross sectional survey was employed in seven primary hospitals of south Gondar zone. Material: The WHO tool for situational analysis to assess emergency and essential surgical care was employed to capture a health facility's capacity to perform basic surgical (including obstetrics and trauma) and anesthesia interventions by investigating four categories of data: infrastructure, human resources, interventions available and equipment. The tool queried the availability of eight types of care providers, 35 surgical interventions and 67 items of equipment. Result: Of the 35 basic interventions listed in the tool, 51.4% basic interventions including caesarean section were available at all facilities. Averaging of 51 beds per facility was reported. The mean distance travelled prior to admission was 42 km. A total of 170 healthcare providers were reported in the seven facilities. This survey found that essential equipment was not consistently available at all of the facilities. Conclusion: Discrepancies in infrastructure, human resources, service provision, and essential equipment and supplies demonstrate the significant gaps in capacity of hospitals to deliver emergency and essential surgical care and effectively addressing the increasing surgical burden of disease and injury in south Gondar zone primary hospitals.

Potential economic benefit of cleft lip and palate repair in sub-Saharan Africa,"Alkire, B.; Hughes, C. D.; Nash, K.; Vincent, J. R.; Meara, J. G.","BACKGROUND: Acceptance of basic surgical care as an essential element of any properly functioning health system is growing. To justify investment in surgical interventions, donors require estimates of the economic benefit of treating surgical disease. The present study aimed to establish a methodology for valuing the potential economic benefit of surgical intervention using cleft lip and palate (CLP) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a model. METHODS: Economic modeling of cleft lip and cleft palate (CLP) in SSA was performed with retrospective demographic and economic data from 2008. The total number of Disability-Adjusted Life-Years (DALYs) secondary to CLP in 2008 was calculated from accepted clefting incidence rates and disability weights taken from the Global Burden of Disease Project. DALYs were then converted to monetary terms ($US), using both a human capital approach and Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) approach. RESULTS: With the human capital approach, the potential economic benefit if all incident cases of CLP in SSA in 2008 were repaired at birth ranged from $252 million to $441 million. With VSL, the potential economic benefit of the same CLP repair would range from $5.4 billion to $9.7 billion.

"Utilising community volunteers can increase the detection and referral of Buruli ulcer cases in endemic communities in Southeast, Nigeria","Alo, C.; Okedo-Alex, I. N.; Akamike, I. C.; Agu, A. P.; Okeke, I. M.; Amuzie, C. I.; Alo, N. C.","Background: Buruli ulcer (BU) is a debilitating neglected tropical disease which causes disability and mostly affects inhabitants in impoverished settings where access to medical care is challenging. This study aims to determine the effect of training community members as volunteers for or in the detection and referral of people who have Buruli ulcer to the hospital. Methods: The following study is a before and after study in the BU-endemic Local Government Areas (LGA) of Ebonyi State. A cluster random sampling technique was used to select 90 volunteers from three LGAs (30 from each LGA). In each LGA, the volunteers underwent a one-day training and six months field work to identify all those who have any form of ulcer on any part of their bodies. A short questionnaire was used to capture socio-demographic characteristics of the patient, site of the ulcer, duration of the ulcer, initial appearance of the ulcer, referral to hospital, result of laboratory investigation, and treatment received. The data was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) for Microsoft Windows version 20 software. The Z test statistic was used to compare the number of referred BU patients before and after the intervention by LGA. The Chi square test was used to examine the association between the dependent and independent variables. Results: The mean age of volunteers was 39 ± 9.5 while mean age of the patients was 42.3 ± 17.1. Most of the ulcers were on the legs (79.4%) and lasted 1–5 years (65.6%). There was a significant increase in the proportion of BU suspects identified by the community volunteers in all 3 LGAs (Afikpo north (p = < 0.001), Abakaliki (p = 0.02), Ikwo (p = 0.001). The duration of the ulcer was associated with the detection and referral of the patients with higher levels of detection and referral among those whose ulcer had lasted 1–5 years in two of the LGAs (P < 0.001).

Predictors of household direct cost of burn injury in adult patients at a tertiary healthcare facility in Ghana: an analytical cross-sectional study in Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital,"Aryee, G.; Aborbi, V. M.; Essuman, R.; Pereko, J.; Djagbletey, R.; Darkwa, E. O.","INTRODUCTION: treatment of severe burn injury generally requires enormous human and material resources including specialized intensive care, staged surgery, and continued restoration. This contributes to the enormous burden on patients and their families. The cost of burn treatment is influenced by many factors including the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patient. This study aimed to determine the costs of burn care and its associated predictive factors in Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital, Ghana. METHODS: an analytical cross-sectional study was conducted among 65 consenting adult patients on admission at the Burns Centre of the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital. Demographic and clinical characteristics of patients as well as the direct cost of burns treatment were obtained. Multiple regression analysis was done to determine the predictors of the direct cost of burn care. RESULTS: a total of sixty-five (65) participants were enrolled in the study with a male-to-female ratio of 1.4: 1 and a mean age of 35.9 ± 14.6 years. Nearly 85% sustained between 10-30% total body surface area burns whilst only 6.2% (4) had burns more than 30% of total body surface area. The mean total cost of burns treatment was GHS 22,333.15 (USD 3,897.58). Surgical treatment, wound dressing and medication charges accounted for 45.6%, 27.5% and 9.8% of the total cost of burn respectively.

Patterns and management outcome of paediatrics burn in a general surgical department: experience from a secondary referral hospital,"Bakhiet, M. Y.; Koko, M. B. A.; Gismalla, M. D.; Assil, S. M.; Bagit, A. A.","Burns are considered the fourth most common type of traumatic injury worldwide with significant morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to disclose the incidence, etiological factors, treatment and outcome of paediatric burns in Sudan. This is a retrospective hospital-based study, conducted during 2016-2019. Patients who presented with burn injuries and managed in the hospital were included in the study. Flowchart sheets were used to collect the data. Then, it was entered and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 21 statistical software (IBM Corporation, Chicago, IL). The total number of patients who fulfill our criteria is 85 with a median age of 4 years (7 months-15 years). Sixty-five percent of them were under 5 years with male predominance (55%). Most patients' burns occurred at home. The median percentage of burn is 18% (2%-90%) which is caused by scalding burn among 55.3% followed by the flame burn in 41.2% of patients. Regarding fluid management, 60% received fluid. Open dressing for burn wounds was done for 75% and close dressing among 15% of patients.

Recurrence of post burn contractures of the elbow and shoulder joints: experience from a Ugandan hospital,"Balumuka, D. D.; Galiwango, G. W.; Alenyo, R.","BACKGROUND: Recurrence of post-burn contractures, following inadequate management of post-burn contractures (PBC), is under reported. It is associated with multiple operations and an increased cost to patients and their families. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of recurrence of PBC of the shoulder and the elbow joint three months after surgical intervention and the associated risk- factors. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study conducted at CoRSU hospital from March 2012 to November 2014. All patients with PBC of the elbow and/or shoulder joint who consented to be in the study and met the inclusion criteria were enrolled. Data was collected using a pretested, coded questionnaire. A goniometer was used to measure the active range of motion of the involved joint. The measurements were recorded in degrees. The data was analysed with STATA version 12.1. RESULTS: 58 patients were enrolled consecutively in the study. There were 36 females and 22 males, with a female to male ratio of 1.6:1. The age range was 0.75-45 years, with a median age of 5 years. The average age at the time of injury was 3.4 years. The most common cause of initial burn injury was scalding. The average number of joints involved per patient was two. There was a high incidence of recurrence of PBC (52 %) among the participants. The shoulder had the highest frequency of recurrence at 67 %. The elbow joint had a frequency of recurrence of 27 %. All participants with both elbow and shoulder joint involvement had PBC recur. The risk factors for recurrence were flame burn (p = 0.007), duration of PBC of more than 1 year (p = 0.018), and incomplete release of the contracture (p = 0.002). The presence of keloids, hypertrophic scars, ulcers and the occurrence of complications at the contracture site were not associated with recurrence of PBC. CONCLUSION: Recurrence of PBC of the elbow and shoulder joint is a common problem. The risk factors should be kept in mind during management of PBC to reduce the recurrence rate.",2015,NA,BMC surgery,15,NA,103,NA,10.1186/s12893-015-0089-y,20169,#1135,Balumuka 2015,NA,Burden; Burns,Burden & Outcome,Access & Barriers,Yes
Prevalence and Severity of Burn Scars in Rural Mozambique,"Barba, P.; Neubauer, D. C.; Cossa, M.; Sieker, J.; Hornacek, M. W.; Lance, S.

W.; Gosman, A.","BACKGROUND: Burn injuries are common in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) and their associated disability is tragic. This study is the first to explore burn scars in rural communities in Mozambique. This work also validated an innovate burn assessment tool, the Morphological African Scar Contractures Classification (MASCC), used to determine surgical need. METHODS: Using a stratified, population-weighted survey, the team interviewed randomly selected households from September 2012 to June 2013. Three rural districts (Chókwè, Nhamatanda, and Ribáuè) were selected to represent the southern, central and northern regions of the country. Injuries were recorded, documented with photographs, and approach to care was gathered. A panel of residents and surgeons reviewed the burn scar images using both the Vancouver Scar Scale and the MASCC, a validated visual scale that categorizes patients into four categories corresponding to levels of surgical intervention. RESULTS: Of the 6104 survey participants, 6% (n = 370) reported one or more burn injuries. Burn injuries were more common in females (57%) and most often occurred on the extremities. Individuals less than 25 years old had a significantly higher odds of reporting a burn scar compared to people older than 45 years. Based on the MASCC, 12% (n = 42) would benefit from surgery to treat contractures. CONCLUSION: Untreated burn injuries are prevalent in rural Mozambique.

Barriers and prospects for skin grafting in burn treatment across African countries,"Bbaale, D.; Mohr, C.; Lindert, J.; Allorto, N.; Mabanza, T.; Katabogama, J. B.; Chamania, S.; Elrod, R.; Boettcher, M.; Elrod, J.","INTRODUCTION: The current standard management of full-thickness or deep dermal burns is early tangential excision and skin grafting. A conservative approach to deep burns without the option of skin grafting results in delayed wound healing, possibly leading to wound infection and is associated with hypertrophic scarring and increased morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study was to improve the understanding of the management and availability to perform skin grafting for burns on the African continent. It also sought to identify challenges and perceived improvements. METHODS: A web-based, structured, closed-formatted, multinational survey was designed to gather information on the current state and availability of skin grafting of burn wounds on the African continent. The questionnaire consisted of 27 questions, available in English and French. It was reviewed within the GAP-Burn collaboration network and sent to 271 health care professionals who had participated in a previous study and had initially been recruited by means of the snowball system. RESULTS: The questionnaire was completed 84 times (response rate: 31.0%), of which 3 were excluded. Responses originated from 22 African countries. The majority 71 (87.7%) resulted from countries with a low Human Development Index (HDI), 7 (8.6%) from medium HDI countries. Split thickness skin grafting (STSG) is performed in 51 (63.0%) centers. The majority considers STSG to reduce length of stay (72.8%) and improve scarring (54.3%), yet some indicated that STSG is associated with increased risk of donor site infection (8.6%) and severe bleeding (7.4%). Factors preventing increased grafting included lack of equipment and training. CONCLUSION: Skin grafting is not performed in a significant number of hospitals treating burns. The majority of the staff believe that more skin grafting would lead to a better outcome. Advocacy and improved infrastructure, human resources coupled with introduction to well-structured health coverage for all in African countries could help to better access and affordability in burn care.",2024,NA,Burns,50,5,1150-1159,38490835,10.1016/j.burns.2024.02.012,13370,#1259,Bbaale 2024,NA,Barriers to Care,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Implementation of a pediatric trauma registry at a national referral center in Kenya: Utility and concern for sustainability,"Bhatia, M. B.; Keung, C. H.; Hogan, J.; Chepkemoi, E.; Li, H.

This study assessed the patterns of pediatric traumatic injuries and treatment at the only free-standing public children's hospital in East Africa as well as the implementation and sustainability of the trauma registry. METHODS: A prospective pediatric trauma registry was established at Shoe4Africa Children's Hospital (S4A) in Eldoret, Kenya. All trauma patients over a six-month period were enrolled. Descriptive analyses were completed via SAS 9.4 to uncover patterns of demographics, trauma mechanisms and injuries, as well as outcomes. Implementation was assessed using the RE-AIM framework. RESULTS: The 425 patients had a median age of 5.14 years (IQR 2.4, 8.7). Average time to care was 267.5 min (IQR 134.0, 625.0). The most common pediatric trauma mechanisms were falls (32.7 %) and burns (17.7 %), but when stratified by age group, toddlers had a higher risk of sustaining injuries from burns and poisonings. Over half (56.2 %) required an operation during the hospitalization. Overall, implementation of the registry was limited by the clinical burden and inadequate personnel. Sustainability of the registry was limited by finances. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to describe the trauma epidemiology from a Kenyan public pediatric hospital.

A survey was conducted in a regional referral hospital in Manyara, Tanzania. In total, 67 patients were included. To obtain information on burn victims in need of surgical care, irrespective of time lapsed from the burn injury, both patients with burn wounds and patients with contractures were included. Information provided by patients and/or caregivers was supplemented with data from patient files and interviews with hospital administration and physicians. In the burn wound group, 50% reached a facility within 24 hours after the injury. Referrals from other health facilities to the regional referral hospital were made within 3 weeks for 74% in this group. Of contracture patients, 74% had sought healthcare after the acute burn injury. Of the same group, only 4% had been treated with skin grafts beforehand, and 70% never received surgical care or a referral. Together, both groups indicated that lack of trust, surgical capacity, and referral timeliness were important factors negatively affecting patient access to surgical care. Accounting for hospital fees indicated patients routinely exceeded the catastrophic expenditure threshold. It was determined that healthcare for burn victims is without financial risk protection.

O. S.; Beynon, F.","Introduction: Trauma accounts for a significant proportion of the global burden of disease, with highest mortality rates seen in Africa. This epidemic is predicted to increase with urbanisation and an aim of the Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce deaths and trauma caused by road accidents. Data available on urban trauma in Sierra Leone is limited. Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study of trauma and injury related presentations to the emergency centre (EC) of Connaught Hospital, the principal adult tertiary referral centre in Freetown, Sierra Leone between January and March 2016. Patient demographics are described with mechanism of injury. Additional data on length of stay and surgical procedures were recorded for admissions to the trauma ward. Results: During the 3-month period, a total of 340 patients with injury presented to the EC, accounting for 11.6% of total attendances and 68% of adult surgical admissions. The majority were male (66%) and mean age was 26 years (IQR 15–40). The proportion of trauma presentations were higher in the evening and at weekends and 41% of patients were triaged as emergency or very urgent cases. Road traffic accidents were the most frequent cause of injury (55%) followed by falls (17%) and assaults (14%). Burns were more common in children. Head and lower limbs were the most commonly injured body parts and a minority of patients underwent surgical procedures. Median length of stay for adult patients was 4.5 days (IQR 2–11) and 7 days (IQR 4–14) for children. Discussion: Injury accounts for a high burden of disease at Connaught Hospital and consumes a significant proportion of EC and hospital resources.

The Met Needs for Pediatric Surgical Conditions in Sierra Leone: Estimating the Gap,"Burgos, C. M.; Bolkan, H. A.; Bash-Taqi, D.; Hagander, L.; Von Schreeb, J.","Background In low-and middle-income countries, there is a gap between the need for surgery and its equitable provision, and a lack of proxy indicators to estimate this gap. Sierra Leone is a West African country with close to three million children. It is unknown to what extent the surgical needs of these children are met. Aim To describe a nationwide provision of pediatric surgical procedures and to assess pediatric hernia repair as a proxy indicator for the shortage of surgical care in the pediatric population in Sierra Leone. Methods We analyzed results from a nationwide facility survey in Sierra Leone that collected data on surgical procedures from operation and anesthesia logbooks in all facilities performing surgery. We included data on all patients under the age of 16 years undergoing surgery. Primary outcomes were rate and volume of surgical procedures. We calculated the expected number of inguinal hernia in children and estimated the unmet need for hernia repair. Results In 2012, a total of 2381 pediatric surgical procedures were performed in Sierra Leone. The rate of pediatric surgical procedures was 84 per 100,000 children 0-15 years of age. The most common pediatric surgical procedure was hernia repair (18%), corresponding to a rate of 16 per 100,000 children 0-15 years of age.

Many children never seek medical care, thus the true prevalence of surgical conditions in children in Uganda is unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of surgical conditions in children in Uganda. METHODS: Using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey, we enumerated 4248 individuals in 2315 households in 105 randomly selected clusters throughout Uganda. Children aged 0-18 were included if randomly selected from the household; for those who could not answer for themselves, parents served as surrogates. RESULTS: Of 2176 children surveyed, 160 (7.4 %) reported a currently untreated surgical condition. Lifetime prevalence of surgical conditions was 14.0 % (305/2176). The predominant cause of surgical conditions was trauma (48.4 %), followed by wounds (19.7 %), acquired deformities (16.2 %), and burns (12.5 %). Of 90 pediatric household deaths, 31.1 % were associated with a surgically treatable proximate cause of death (28/90 deaths).

METHODS: Our sample comprised 57 households in 5 enumeration areas in the Wakiso District, in central Uganda. Our survey tool was the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical need. A household representative completed demographic and household death information, and 2 randomly selected household members completed questions on surgical conditions. RESULTS: Of 96 participants, 6 (6.3%; 95% CI, 2.3-13.1) had an existing, untreated surgical condition. The lifetime prevalence of surgical conditions was 26% (25/96). The most common barrier to access to care was lack of financial resources. Of the 3 deaths reported, 2 were associated with surgery. The mean household interview time was 36 minutes. The greatest challenge was efficient coordination with local team members and government officials. CONCLUSION: In this setting, the current prevalence of surgical conditions was nearly 1 in 10 persons, and lifetime occurrence was high, at 1 in 4 persons.

Burn management in sub-Saharan Africa: opportunities for implementation of dedicated training and development of specialty centers,"Calland, J. F.; Holland, M. C.; Mwizerwa, O.; Petroze, R. T.; Ntakiyiruta, G.; Patel, K.; Gampper, T. J.; Byiringiro, J. C.; Campbell, C. A.","BACKGROUND: In low- and middle-income countries burn injuries remain responsible for a large burden of death and disability. Given an annual worldwide incidence of almost 11 million new individuals affected per year, major burn injuries have a higher annual incidence than HIV and tuberculosis combined. METHODS: A survey instrument was adapted for use as an international assessment tool and then used to measure the availability of personnel, materials, equipment, medicines, and facility resources in nine Rwandan hospitals, including three referral centers. RESULTS: Forty-four percent of surveyed hospitals had a dedicated acute-care burn ward, while two-thirds had intensive care options. Relevant wound-care supplies were widely available, but gaps in the availability of critical pieces of equipment such as monitors, ventilators, infusion pumps, electrocautery, and dermatomes were discovered in many of the surveyed institutions, including referral hospitals. Early excision and grafting were not performed in any of the hospitals and there were no physicians with specialty training in burn care. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas all surveyed hospitals were theoretically equipped to handle the initial resuscitation of burn patients, none of the hospitals were capable of delivering comprehensive care due to gaps in equipment, personnel, protocols, and training.

J.","BACKGROUND: Pediatric fractures are common in Malawi, and surgical care, when needed, remains inaccessible to many. Understanding which children in Malawi receive surgery or nonsurgical treatment would help set priorities for trauma system development. METHODS: We used multivariate logistic regression to evaluate associations between surgical treatment and age, sex, school enrollment, injury mechanism, fracture type, open fracture, referral status, hospital of presentation, delayed presentation (≥2 days), healthcare provider, and inpatient vs outpatient treatment. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2020, 10,400 pediatric fractures were recorded in the Malawi Fracture Registry. Fractures were most commonly of the wrist (26%), forearm (17%), and elbow (14%). Surgical fixation was performed on 4.0% of patients, and 24 (13.0%) open fractures were treated nonsurgically, without débridement or fixation.

Surgical Care in Liberia and Implications for Capacity Building,"Chao, T. E.; Patel, P. B.; Kikubaire, M.; Niescierenko, M.; Hagander, L.; Meara, J. G.","BACKGROUND: Situational needs of health care facilities inform the optimal allocation of resources and quality improvement efforts. This study examines surgical care delivery metrics at a tertiary care institution in Liberia. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed operative and ward logbooks from January 1 to December 31, 2012. Data parameters included patients' age, diagnosis, procedure, mortality, and perioperative provider information. RESULTS: In 2012, 1,036 operations were performed. The breakdown of adult surgical cases reveals 452 (45.1%) general surgery operations, 192 (18.5%) orthopedic operations, and 180 (17.4%) ophthalmic operations. Other significant case volume included urologic 53 (5.1%), ENT 36 (3.5%), neurosurgical 31 (3.0%), vascular 24 (2.3%), and plastic 14 (1.4%) operations. Pediatric patients accounted for 24.5% (243) of surgical cases, and 9% of pediatric surgical cases were for hydrocephalus. General, spinal, and total intravenous anesthesia was provided by non-physician personnel, except when surgeons provided their own anesthesia. Ward logs documented 7.4% mortality among all patients admitted to the surgical ward, most of which occurred after exploratory laparotomy (44%), in burn (14%) patients, and in patients with head/neck emergencies (12%). CONCLUSIONS: This operative log review can be used to identify surgical practice patterns, needs, and deficits in order to inform the growth of surgical capacity at Liberia's only tertiary medical institution. Using this data to identify critical areas of high-yield operations (e.g., for pediatric hydrocephalus), or excessively high mortality rates (e.g., in burn care), can focus the direction of limited resources toward areas of need.

Surgical care for the direct and indirect victims of violence in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo,"Chu, K.; Havet, P.; Ford, N.; Trelles, M.","BACKGROUND: The provision of surgical assistance in conflict is often associated with care for victims of violence. However, there is an increasing appreciation that surgical care is needed for non-traumatic morbidities. In this paper we report on surgical interventions carried out by Médecins sans Frontières in Masisi, North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo to contribute to the scarce evidence base on surgical needs in conflict. METHODS: We analysed data on all surgical interventions done at Masisi district hospital between September 2007 and December 2009. Types of interventions are described, and logistic regression used to model associations with violence-related injury. RESULTS: 2869 operations were performed on 2441 patients. Obstetric emergencies accounted for over half (675, 57%) of all surgical pathology and infections for another quarter (160, 14%). Trauma-related injuries accounted for only one quarter (681, 24%) of all interventions; among these, 363 (13%) were violence-related. Male gender (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 20.0, p < 0.001), military status (AOR = 4.1, p < 0.001), and age less than 20 years (AOR = 2.1, p < 0.001) were associated with violence-related injury. Immediate peri-operative mortality was 0.2%. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, most surgical interventions were unrelated to violent trauma and rather reflected the general surgical needs of a low-income tropical country. Programs in conflict zones in low-income countries need to be prepared to treat both the war-wounded and non-trauma related life-threatening surgical needs of the general population.

Providing surgical care in Somalia: A model of task shifting,"Chu, K. M.; Ford, N. P.; Trelles, M.","BACKGROUND: Somalia is one of the most political unstable countries in the world. Ongoing insecurity has forced an inconsistent medical response by the international community, with little data collection. This paper describes the ""remote"" model of surgical care by Medecins Sans Frontieres, in Guri-El, Somalia. The challenges of providing the necessary prerequisites for safe surgery are discussed as well as the successes and limitations of task shifting in this resource-limited context. METHODS: In January 2006, MSF opened a project in Guri-El located between Mogadishu and Galcayo. The objectives were to reduce mortality due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth and from violent and non-violent trauma. At the start of the program, expatriate surgeons and anesthesiologists established safe surgical practices and performed surgical procedures. After January 2008, expatriates were evacuated due to insecurity and surgical care has been provided by local Somalian doctors and nurses with periodic supervisory visits from expatriate staff. RESULTS: Between October 2006 and December 2009, 2086 operations were performed on 1602 patients. The majority (1049, 65%) were male and the median age was 22 (interquartile range, 17-30). 1460 (70%) of interventions were emergent. Trauma accounted for 76% (1585) of all surgical pathology; gunshot wounds accounted for 89% (584) of violent injuries. Operative mortality (0.5% of all surgical interventions) was not higher when Somalian staff provided care compared to when expatriate surgeons and anesthesiologists. CONCLUSIONS: The delivery of surgical care in any conflict-settings is difficult, but in situations where international support is limited, the challenges are more extreme. In this model, task shifting, or the provision of services by less trained cadres, was utilized and peri-operative mortality remained low demonstrating that safe surgical practices can be accomplished even without the presence of fully trained surgeon and anesthesiologists. If security improves in Somalia, on-site training by expatriate surgeons and anesthesiologists will be re-established. Until then, the best way MSF has found to support surgical care in Somalia is continue to support in a ""remote"" manner.",2011,NA,Confl Health,5,NA,12,21762491,10.1186/1752-1505-5-12,15183,#1985,Chu 2011,NA,Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
A Systematic Review of the Cost-Effectiveness of Cleft Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: What is Needed?,"Chung, K. Y.; Ho, G.; Erman, A.; Bielecki, J. M.; Forrest, C. R.; Sander, B.","Objective: The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review that summarizes the cost-effectiveness of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on existing literature. Design: We searched eleven electronic databases for articles from January 1, 2000 to December 29, 2020. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020148402). Two reviewers independently conducted primary and secondary screening, and data extraction. Setting: All CL/P cost-effectiveness analyses in LMIC settings. Patients, Participants: In total, 2883 citations were screened. Eleven articles encompassing 1,001,675 patients from 86 LMICs were included. Main Outcome Measures: We used cost-effectiveness thresholds of 1% to 51% of a country's gross domestic product per capita (GDP/capita), a conservative threshold recommended for LMICs. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Results: Primary CL/P repair was cost-effective at the threshold of 51% of a country's GDP/capita across all studies. However, only 1 study met at least 70% of the JBI criteria. There is a need for context-specific cost and health outcome data for primary CL/P repair, complications, and existing multidisciplinary management in LMICs. Conclusions: Existing economic evaluations suggest primary CL/P repair is cost-effective, however context-specific local data will make future cost-effectiveness analyses more relevant to local decision-makers and lead to better-informed resource allocation decisions in LMICs.",2023,NA,Cleft Palate Craniofacial Journal,60,12,1600-1608,NA,10.1177/10556656221111028,15815,#1993,Chung 2023,NA,Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations; Cost,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Prioritisation of Surgery in the National Health Strategic Plans of Africa: A Systematic Review,"Citron, I.; Chokotho, L.; Lavy, C.","INTRODUCTION: Disease amenable to surgical intervention accounts for 11-15 % of world disability and there is increasing interest in surgery as a global public health issue. National Health Strategic Plans (NHSPs) reflect countries' long-term health priorities, plans and targets. These plans were analysed to assess the prioritisation of surgery as a public health issue in Africa. METHODS: NHSPs of 43 independent Sub-Saharan African countries available in the public domain in March 2014 in French or English were searched electronically for key terms: surg*, ortho*, trauma, cancer, appendic*, laparotomy, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria. They were then searched manually for disease prevalence, targets, and human resources. RESULTS: 19 % of NHSPs had no mention of surgery or surgical conditions. 63 % had five or less mentions of surgery. HIV and malaria had 3772 mentions across all the policies, compared to surgery with only 376 mentions. Trauma had 239 mentions, while the common surgical conditions of appendicitis, laparotomy and hernia had no mentions at all. Over 95 % of NHSPs specifically mentioned the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, infant mortality and maternal mortality. Whereas, the most commonly mentioned surgical condition for which a prevalence was given was trauma, in only 47 % of policies. All NHSPs had plans and measurable targets for the reduction of HIV and tuberculosis. Of the total 4064 health targets, only 2 % were related to surgical conditions or surgical care. 33 % of policies had no surgical targets. DISCUSSION: NHSPs are the best available measure of health service and planning priorities. It is clear from our findings that surgery is poorly represented and that surgical conditions and surgical treatment are not widely recognised as a public health priority. Greater prioritisation of surgery in national health strategic policies is required to build resilient surgical systems.",2016,NA,World J Surg,40,4,779-83,26711637,10.1007/s00268-015-3333-9,14755,#2011,Citron 2016,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-13 04:49:48)(Select): general surgical capacity / barriers to care

OBJECTIVE To estimate the prevalence of pediatric surgical conditions across Somaliland using a nationwide community-based household survey. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study was conducted through a national community-based sampling survey from August through December 2017 in Somaliland. Participants were 1503 children surveyed using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The SOSAS survey contains 2 components, including a section on household demographics, deaths, and financial information and sections querying children's history of surgical conditions. RESULTS In this cross-sectional study that included 1503 children (55.6% male; mean [SE] age, 6.4 [0.1] years), 221 surgical conditions were identified among 196 children, yielding a mean (SE) prevalence of pediatric surgical conditions of 12.2%(1.5%). Only 53 of these 221 surgical conditions (23.7%) had been surgically corrected at the time of the survey. The most common conditions encountered were congenital anomalies (33.8%) and wound-related injuries (24.6%). Nationally, an estimated 256 745 children have surgical conditions, with an estimated 88 345 to 199 639 children having unmet surgical needs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Using national sampling, this study found that children have a high burden of surgical conditions in Somaliland. These data highlight the need for a scale-up of pediatric surgical infrastructure and resources to provide the needed surgical care for children in LMICs.",2019,NA,JAMA Netw.

"Ten-year experience of more than 35,000 orofacial clefts in Africa","Conway, J. C.; Taub, P. J.; Kling, R.; Oberoi, K.; Doucette, J.; Jabs, E. W.","Background: Surgical correction of orofacial clefts greatly mitigates negative outcomes. However, access to reconstructive surgery is limited in developing countries. The present study reviews epidemiological data from a single charitable organization, Smile Train, with a database of surgical cases from 33 African countries from 2001-2011. Methods: Demographic and clinical patient data were collected from questionnaires completed by the participating surgeons. These data were recorded in Excel, analyzed using SPSS and compared with previously reported data. Results: Questionnaires were completed for 36,384 patients by 389 African surgeons. The distribution of clefts was: 34.44% clefts of the lip (CL), 58.87% clefts of the lip and palate (CLP), and 6.69% clefts of the palate only (CP). The male to female ratio was 1.46:1, and the unilateral: bilateral ratio 2.93:1, with left-sided predominance 1.69:1. Associated anomalies were found in 4.18% of patients. The most frequent surgeries included primary lip/nose repairs, unilateral (68.36%) and bilateral (11.84%). There was seasonal variation in the frequency of oral cleft births with the highest in January and lowest by December. The average age at surgery was 9.34 years and increased in countries with lower gross domestic products. The average hospital stay was 4.5 days. The reported complication rate was 1.92%. Conclusions: With the exception of cleft palates, results follow trends of worldwide epidemiologic reports of 25% CL, 50% CLP, and 25% CP, 2:1 unilateral:bilateral and left:right ratios, and male predominance. Fewer than expected patients, especially females, presented with isolated cleft palates, suggesting that limitations in economic resources and cultural aesthetics of the obvious lip deformity may outweigh functional concerns and access to treatment for females. A fewer than expected associated anomalies suggests either true ethnic variation, or that more severely-affected patients are not presenting for treatment. The epidemiology of orofacial clefting in Africa has been difficult to assess due to the diversity of the continent and the considerable variation among study designs. The large sample size of the data collected provides a basis for further study of the epidemiology of orofacial clefting in Africa.",2015,NA,BMC Psychiatry,15,1,NA,NA,10.1186/s12887-015-0328-5,20320,#2090,Conway 2015,NA,Burden; Cleft Palate,Burden & Outcome,Access & Barriers,Yes
The Cost of Providing District-Level Surgery in Malawi,"Cornelissen, D.; Mwapasa, G.; Gajewski, J.; McCauley, T.; Borgstein, E.; Brugha, R.; Bijlmakers, L.","Three district hospitals in Malawi that provide essential surgery, which for many patients can be lifesaving or prevent disability, formed the setting of this costing study. All resources used at district hospitals for the delivery of surgery were identified and quantified. The hospital departments were divided into three categories of cost centres-the final cost centre, intermediate and ancillary cost centres. All costs of human resources, buildings, equipment, medical and non-medical supplies and utilities were quantified and allocated to surgery through step-down accounting. The total cost of surgery, including post-operative care, ranged from US$ 329,000 per year to more than twice that amount at one of the hospitals. At two hospitals, it represented 16-17% of the total cost of running the hospital. The main cost drivers of surgery were transport and inpatient services, including catering. The cost of a C-section ranged from $ 164 to 638 that of a hernia repair from $ 137 to 598. Evacuations from uterus were cheapest mainly because of the shorter duration of patient stay. Low bed occupancy rates and utilisation rates of the operating theatres suggest overcapacity but may also indicate a potential to scale up surgery. This may be achieved by adding surgical staff, although there may be rate-limiting steps, such as demand for surgery in the community or capacity to provide anaesthesia. If a scale-up of surgery cannot be realised, hospital managers may be forced to reduce the number of beds, reorganise wards and/or reallocate staff to achieve better economies of scale.",2018,NA,World J.Surg.,42,1,46-53,WOS:000418579500008,10.1007/s00268-017-4166-5,23980,#2101,Cornelissen 2018,Sabina Rodriguez (2025-02-11 09:10:01)(Select): Provides some information and disaggregation by types of surgery (injury-related surgery which includes skin grafting).

"Global variation in cleft palate repairs: An analysis of 352,191 primary cleft repairs in low- to higher-middle-income countries","Cubitt, J. J.; Hodges, A. M.; Van Lierde, K. M.; Swan, M. C.","Results: A significant correlation exists between both the income of a country and its geographical region to the ratio of lip and palate repair procedures undertaken. Higher-income countries had a higher ratio of cleft palate repairs. Countries in sub-Saharan Africa have the lowest proportion of cleft palate repairs. Methods: Data were obtained from the Smile Train database of 352,191 consecutive cleft operations performed between 2008 and 2011 in low- to higher-middle-income countries. The ratio of cleft lip to palate repair was analyzed as a function of geographic region and by country income (gross national income). Conclusion: This study emphasizes that many babies born with cleft palates in resource-poor regions do not have their palates repaired. This finding may be explained by an increased neonatal mortality in cleft palate babies. Furthermore, fewer isolated palatal clefts may present to an appropriate health care facility or there may be a reluctance to treat cleft palate due to concerns regarding higher perioperative risks or the lack of available surgical and anesthetic expertise. Objectives: Resources for repair of cleft lip and palate may be lacking in low- and middle-income countries. The Smile Train is a registered charity that supports cleft repair in resource-poor settings. In the global health care challenge, it has been suggested that many babies born with cleft palates are not repaired.

The purpose of this study was to estimate the prevalence rate of burnout and its associated factors in a sample of resident physicians in Sudan. Methods A cross-sectional design was used to assess the burnout syndrome among resident physicians at the teaching hospitals of Wad-Medani in Gezira state, east-central Sudan. Three hundred resident physicians at the dermatology, general surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, psychiatry, ear, nose and throat (ENT), oncology, urology, and internal medicine departments, were approached and invited to participate in the study. The Arabic version of the Maslach Burnout Inventory was distributed to respondents from July to October 2021. Results From the 300 resident physicians, 208 (69.3%) responded. The average age of the study population was 29.99 ± 3.01 years, with more than half were females (56.7%), single (59.6%), and with more than three years of residency experience (50.5%). In total, 86.1% met the criteria for burnout in at least one dimension and 13.9% in all three dimensions. On the dimension of emotional exhaustion (EE), 70.7% reported high levels of burnout. While, 44.2% reported high levels of depersonalization (DP), and 73.1% experienced a sense of decreased professional accomplishment (PA). There were significant differences in burnout, EE, and DP levels among different specialties, with the pediatrics-specialty trainees reported higher levels. Burnout syndrome was associated with the working hours per single duty; participants who reported working for more than 24 hours had experienced higher levels of burnout, EE, and DP.

A cross-sectional survey of essential surgical capacity in Somalia,"Elkheir, N.; Sharma, A.; Cherian, M.; Saleh, O. A.; Everard, M.; Popal, G. R.; Ibrahim, A. A.","Objective: To assess life-saving and disability-preventing surgical services (including emergency, trauma, obstetrics, anaesthesia) of health facilities in Somalia and to assist in the planning of strategies for strengthening surgical care systems. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: Health facilities in all 3 administrative zones of Somalia; northwest Somalia (NWS), known as Somaliland; northeast Somalia (NES), known as Puntland; and south/central Somalia (SCS). Participants: 14 health facilities. Measures: The WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care was employed to capture a health facility's capacity to deliver surgical and anaesthesia services by investigating four categories of data: infrastructure, human resources, interventions available and equipment. Results: The 14 facilities surveyed in Somalia represent 10 of the 18 districts throughout the country. The facilities serve an average patient population of 331 250 people, and 12 of the 14 identify as hospitals. While major surgical procedures were provided at many facilities (caesarean section, laparotomy, appendicectomy, etc), only 22% had fully available oxygen access, 50% fully available electricity and less than 30% had any management guidelines for emergency and surgical care. Furthermore, only 36% were able to provide general anaesthesia inhalation due to lack of skills, supplies and equipment. Basic supplies for airway management and the prevention of infection transmission were severely lacking in most facilities. Conclusions: According to the results of the WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess Emergency and Essential Surgical Care survey, there exist significant gaps in the capacity of emergency and essential surgical services in Somalia including inadequacies in essential equipment, service provision and infrastructure. The information provided by the WHO tool can serve as a basis for evidence-based decisions on country-level policy regarding the allocation of resources and provision of emergency and essential surgical services.",2014,NA,BMJ Open,4,5,NA,NA,10.1136/bmjopen-2013-004360,20669,#2689,Elkheir 2014,NA,Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Pattern of Orofacial Clefts at A Tertiary Care Hospital in Ethiopia,"Eshete, M.","BACKGROUND: Clefts of the lip and/or palate are the most common craniofacial birth defects.

G.","IMPORTANCE: Surgical care is widely unavailable in developing countries; advocates recommend that countries evaluate and report on access to surgical care to improve availability and aid health planners in decision making. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the infrastructure, capacity, and availability of surgical care in Zambia to inform health policy priorities. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this observational study, all hospitals providing surgical care were identified in cooperation with the Zambian Ministry of Health. On-site data collection was conducted from February 1 through August 30, 2011, with an adapted World Health Organization Global Initiative for Emergency and Essential Surgical Care survey. Data collection at each facility included interviews with hospital personnel and assessment of material resources. Data were geocoded and analyzed in a data visualization platform from March 1 to December 1, 2015. We analyzed time and distance to surgical services, as well as the proportion of the population living within 2 hours from a facility providing surgical care. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Surgical capacity, supplies, human resources, and infrastructure at each surgical facility, as well as the population living within 2 hours from a hospital providing surgical care. RESULTS: Data were collected from all 103 surgical facilities identified as providing surgical care. When including all surgical facilities (regardless of human resources and supplies), 14.9% of the population (2 166 460 of 14 500 000 people) lived more than 2 hours from surgical care. However, only 17 hospitals (16.5%) met the World Health Organization minimum standards of surgical safety; when limiting the analysis to these hospitals, 65.9% of the population (9 552 780 people) lived in an area that was more than 2 hours from a surgical facility. Geographic analysis of emergency and essential surgical care, defined as access to trauma care, obstetric care, and care of common abdominal emergencies, found that 80.7% of the population (11 704 700 people) lived in an area that was more than 2 hours from these surgical facilities.

Motorcycle Road Traffic Injuries in a Tertiary Hospital in Nigeria: A Reflection of the Trauma Care Crisis,"Ezeme, C.; Oladeji, E. O.; Baiyewu, L. A.; Okunola, M. O.; Ogunlade, S. O.","BACKGROUND:  Motorcycle is a popular and growing form of intracity transportation in many Nigerian cities owing mainly to poorly developed transport systems. It contributes significantly to road traffic injuries (RTIs), which are a leading cause of death and disabilities in low- and middle-income countries. There is a lack of information on the quality of care received and the treatment outcome in patients with motorcycle RTIs in Ibadan and many cities in Nigeria. This study evaluated the characteristics of motorcycle-related RTIs, the quality of care received, and the outcome of the patients managed in a trauma reference center in Ibadan, Nigeria. METHODS:  This is a prospective cohort study. All patients involved in motorcycle road traffic crashes who presented to the emergency department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan, between August 2020 and May 2021, were included in the study. Data on patients' demographics, history of the crash, injuries sustained, definitive care, and the outcome of in-hospital care were obtained from patients (and/or their carers) and the medical records. RESULTS:  A total of 156 patients were seen, out of which 74.4% were males. About 76.2% were less than 45 years with a mean age of 35.7 ± 16.3 years, and the peak age group was 18-44 years. About 37 (23.7%) patients were involved in motorcycle/motorcycle collisions, whereas 67 (42.9%) were involved in motorcycle/car collisions. Riders accounted for 59.6% (93), and although 62% (97) of the patients presented within six hours of the crash, only 10.9% (17) presented within one hour. About 48% received some form of prehospital care rendered by officials of the Federal Road Safety Corps, police officers, or passers-by, and none was attended by a dedicated emergency ambulance team. The head and the limbs were the most affected anatomical areas, while orthopedic and neurosurgical procedures were the most required emergency surgical interventions. About 66.7% were discharged home with only 21.2% of them fit to return to pre-trauma function at discharge, and the mortality rate was 17.3%. Patients who presented at 7-24 hours (AOR = 2.99; 95% CI = 1.04-8.62; p-value = 0.043) and >24 hours after the accident (AOR = 5.65; 95% CI = 1.64-19.53; p-value = 0.006) were 2.99 and 5.65 times, respectively, more likely to die from motorcycle-related accident compared to those who presented within the first six hours.

"Critical shortage of capacity to deliver safe paediatric surgery in sub-Saharan Africa: evidence from 67 hospitals in Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania","Gajewski, J.; Pittalis, C.; Borgstein, E.; Bijlmakers, L.; Mwapasa, G.; Cheelo, M.; Juma, A.; Sardana, M.; Brugha, R.","Introduction: Paediatric surgical care is a significant challenge in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where 42% of the population are children. Building paediatric surgical capacity to meet SSA country needs is a priority. This study aimed to assess district hospital paediatric surgical capacity in three countries: Malawi, Tanzania and Zambia (MTZ). Methods: Data from 67 district-level hospitals in MTZ were collected using a PediPIPES survey tool. Its five components are procedures, personnel, infrastructure, equipment, and supplies. A PediPIPES Index was calculated for each country, and a two-tailed analysis of variance test was used to explore cross-country comparisons. Results: Similar paediatric surgical capacity index scores and shortages were observed across countries, greater in Malawi and less in Tanzania. Almost all hospitals reported the capacity to perform common minor surgical procedures and less complex resuscitation interventions. Capacity to undertake common abdominal, orthopaedic and urogenital procedures varied—more often reported in Malawi and less often in Tanzania. There were no paediatric or general surgeons or anaesthesiologists at district hospitals. General medical officers with some training to do surgery on children were present (more often in Zambia). Paediatric surgical equipment and supplies were poor in all three countries. Malawi district hospitals had the poorest supply of electricity and water. Conclusions: With no specialists in district hospitals in MTZ, access to safe paediatric surgery is compromised, aggravated by shortages of infrastructure, equipment and supplies. Significant investments are required to address these shortfalls. SSA countries need to define what procedures are appropriate to national, referral and district hospital levels and ensure that an appropriate paediatric surgical workforce is in place at district hospitals, trained and supervised to undertake these essential surgical procedures so as to meet population needs.",2023,NA,Frontiers in Pediatrics,11,NA,NA,NA,10.3389/fped.2023.1189676,16035,#3108,Gajewski 2023,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-14 02:05:55)(Select): surgical capacity; barriers to care; Rachel Wangi (2025-02-12 00:02:11)(Select): points to surgical capacity. procedures included management of burns and skin grafting ;,Barriers to Care; Children / Pediatric Population; Surgical Capacity,Access & Barriers,Access & Barriers,Yes
Access to Operative Intervention Reduces Mortality in Adult Burn Patients in a Resource-Limited Setting in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Gallaher, J. R.; Banda, W.; Robinson, B.; Purcell, L. N.; Charles, A.","INTRODUCTION: Early excision and grafting remains the standard of care after burn injury. However, in a resource-limited setting, operative capacity often limits patient access to surgical intervention. This study sought to describe access to excision and grafting for adult burn patients in a sub-Saharan African burn unit and its relationship with burn-associated mortality. METHODS: We analyzed patients recorded in the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Registry in Lilongwe, Malawi from 2011-2019. We examined patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes for adults aged ≥16 years. Modified Poisson regression modeling was used to identify risk factors for mortality. RESULTS: Five hundred and seventy-three patients were included. Median age was 30 years (IQR 23-40) with a male preponderance (63%). Median percent total body surface area burned (%TBSA) was 15% (IQR 8-26) and 68% of burns were caused by flame. 27% (n = 154) had burn excision with skin grafting, with a median time to operation of 18 days (IQR 9-38). When adjusted for age, %TBSA, and time to presentation, operative intervention conferred a survival benefit for patients with flame burns with a RR 0.16 (95% CI 0.06, 0.42). CONCLUSIONS: In a resource-limiting setting, access to the operating room is inadequate, and burn patients are not prioritized. While many scald burn patients may be managed with wound care alone, patients with flame burn require surgical intervention to improve clinical outcomes. Burn injury in this region continues to confer a high risk of mortality, and more investment in operative capacity is imperative.",2020,NA,World J Surg,44,11,3629-3635,32666267,10.1007/s00268-020-05684-y,13563,#3117,Gallaher 2020,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-22 03:14:40)(Select): barriers to access; burden --> burns;,Access to Healthcare; Burns,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Essential surgery at the district hospital: A retrospective descriptive analysis in three african countries,"Galukande, M.; von Schreeb, J.; Wladis, A.; Mbembati, N.; de Miranda, H.; Kruk, M.

B.","Background Surgical conditions contribute significantly to the disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet there is an apparent neglect of surgical care as a public health intervention to counter this burden. There is increasing enthusiasm to reverse this trend, by promoting essential surgical services at the district hospital, the first point of contact for critical conditions for rural populations. This study investigated the scope of surgery conducted at district hospitals in three sub-Saharan African countries. Methods and Findings In a retrospective descriptive study, field data were collected from eight district hospitals in Uganda, Tanzania, and Mozambique using a standardized form and interviews with key informants. Overall, the scope of surgical procedures performed was narrow and included mainly essential and life-saving emergency procedures. Surgical output varied across hospitals from five to 45 major procedures/10,000 people. Obstetric operations were most common and included cesarean sections and uterine evacuations. Hernia repair and wound care accounted for 65% of general surgical procedures. The number of beds in the studied hospitals ranged from 0.2 to 1.0 per 1,000 population. Conclusion The findings of this study clearly indicate low levels of surgical care provision at the district level for the hospitals studied. The extent to which this translates into unmet need remains unknown although the very low proportions of live births in the catchment areas of these eight hospitals that are born by cesarean section suggest that there is a substantial unmet need for surgical services. The district hospital in the current health system in sub-Saharan Africa lends itself to feasible integration of essential surgery into the spectrum of comprehensive primary care services. It is therefore critical that the surgical capacity of the district hospital is significantly expanded; this will result in sustainable preventable morbidity and mortality. © 2010 Galukande et al.",2010,NA,PLoS Medicine,7,3,1-10,NA,10.1371/journal.pmed.1000243,21877,#3127,Galukande 2010,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-04 04:42:30)(Select): interesting paper/good insights. certainly useful; Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-04 04:41:00)(Select): surgical capacity ; barriers

Cost/DALY averted in a small hospital in Sierra Leone: what is the relative contribution of different services?,"Gosselin, R. A.; Thind, A.; Bellardinelli, A.","BACKGROUND: A cost-effective analysis (CEA) can be a useful tool to guide resource allocation decisions. However, there is a dearth of evidence on the cost/disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted by health facilities in the developing world. METHODS: We conducted a study to calculate the costs and the DALYs averted by an entire hospital in Sierra Leone, using the method suggested by McCord and Chowdhury (Int J Gynaecol Obstet 2003;81:83-92). RESULTS: For the 3-month study period, total costs were calculated to be dollar 369,774. Using the approach of McCord and Chowdhury, we calculated that 11,282 DALYs were averted during the study period, resulting in a cost/DALY averted of dollar 32.78. This figure compares favorably to other non-surgical health interventions in developing countries. We found that while surgery accounts for 63% of total caseload, it contributes to 38% of the total DALYs averted. CONCLUSIONS: Surgical treatment of some common pathologies in developing countries may be more cost-effective than previously thought, and our results provide evidence for the inclusion of surgery as part of the basic public health armamentarium in developing countries. However, these results are highly context-specific, and more research is needed from developing countries to further refine the methodology and analysis.",2006,NA,World J Surg,30,4,505-11,16528459,10.1007/s00268-005-0609-5,14212,#3341,Gosselin 2006,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-31 01:30:31)(Select): PRresents the costs averted when a condition is managed.

Recent global children's surgical guidelines suggest training and support of general surgeons in rural regional hospitals as an effective approach to increasing pediatric surgical capacity. METHODS: Two years of a prospective clinical database of children's surgery admissions at 2 regional referral hospitals in Uganda were reviewed. Primary outcomes included case volume and clinical outcomes of children at each hospital. Additionally, the disability-adjusted life-years averted by delivery of pediatric surgical services at these hospitals were calculated. Using a value of statistical life calculation, we also estimated the economic benefit of the pediatric surgical care currently being delivered. RESULTS: From 2016 to 2019, more than 300 surgical procedures were performed at each hospital per year. The majority of cases were standard general surgery cases including hernia repairs and intussusception as well as procedures for surgical infections and trauma. In-hospital mortality was 2.4% in Soroti and 1% in Lacor. Pediatric surgical capacity at these hospitals resulted in over 12,400 disability-adjusted life-years averted/year. This represents an estimated economic benefit of 10.2 million US dollars/year to the Ugandan society. CONCLUSION: This investigation demonstrates that lifesaving pediatric procedures are safely performed by general surgeons in Uganda.

Systematic review of met and unmet need of surgical disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa,"Grimes, C. E.; Law, R. S.; Borgstein, E. S.; Mkandawire, N. C.; Lavy, C. B.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the burden of surgical disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa, where district and rural hospitals are the main providers of care. The present study sought to analyze what is known about the met and unmet need of surgical disease. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of surveys in rural areas, information on surgical admissions, and operations performed within rural and district hospitals. Data were extrapolated to calculate the amount of surgical disease per 100,000 population and the number of operations performed per 100,000 population. These extrapolations were used to estimate the total, the met, and the unmet need of surgical disease. RESULTS: The estimated overall incidence of nonfatal injury is at least 1,690/100,000 population per year. Morbidity as a result of injury is up to 190/100,000 population per year, and the annual mortality from injury is 53-92/100,000. District hospitals perform 6 fracture reductions (95% CI: 0.1-12)/100,000 population per year and 14 laparotomies (95% CI: 7-21)/100,000 per year. The incidence of peritonitis and bowel obstruction is unknown, although it may be as high as 1,364/100,000 population for the acute abdomen. The annual total need for inguinal hernia repair is estimated to be a minimum of 205/100,000 population.

The impact and cost-effectiveness of the Amref Health Africa-Smile Train Cleft Lip and Palate Surgical Repair Programme in Eastern and Central Africa,"Hamze, H.; Mengiste, A.; Carter, J.","INTRODUCTION: Cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) is a congenital malformation that causes significant morbidity in low and middle income countries. Amref Health Africa has partnered with Smile Train to provide CLP surgeries since 2006. METHODS: We analyzed anonymized data of 37,274 CLP patients from the Smile Train database operated on in eastern and central Africa between 2006 and 2014. Cases were analyzed by age, gender, country and surgery type. The impact of cleft surgery was determined by measuring averted Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) and delayed averted DALYs. We used mean Smile Train costs to calculate cost-effectiveness. We calculated economic benefit using the human capital approach and Value of Statistical Life (VSL) methods. RESULTS: The median age at time of primary surgery was 5.4 years. A total of 207,879 DALYs were averted at a total estimated cost of US$13 million. Mean averted DALYs per patient were 5.6, and mean cost per averted DALY was $62.8. Total delayed burden of disease from late age at surgery was 36,352 DALYs. Surgical correction resulted in $292 million in economic gain using the human capital approach and $2.4 billion using VSL methods.

"Creating an Outpatient, Local Anesthetic Hand Operating Room in a Resource-Constrained Ghanaian Hospital Builds Surgical Capacity and Financial Stability","Holoyda, K. A.; Farhat, B.; Lalonde, D. H.; Owusu-Danso, O.; Agbenorku, P.; Hoyte-Williams, P. E.; Rockwell, W. B.","INTRODUCTION: Expanding surgical capacity is very difficult in resource-constrained countries. Financial input and additional physical operating room space are needed. The surgical patient volume exists, but the lack of operating room time causes postponement of cases. Hand surgery is particularly important as it improves patient function and allows for a timely return to the workforce after injury. Some hand surgery cases may be performed under local anesthesia with a very basic instrument set in a procedure room. This arrangement eliminates the need and financial burden of an equipped operating room and the need for an anesthesiologist. We hypothesized that performing hand surgery in a simple procedure room by a surgeon with knowledge of adequate local anesthesia could increase hand surgery capacity significantly in a low-income country. METHODS: This technique has been instituted at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, with the use of a single procedure room that was previously used for storage. A surgeon trained in performing wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet technique visited Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital and provided lectures about hand surgery under local anesthesia and evidence-based sterility for 6 years. The number and type of cases performed in the procedure room were recorded for the first 11 months after it opened in 2017. RESULTS: For 11 months, use of this room had increased surgical capacity by 33 cases per month. Patient ages ranged from 2 months to 65 years. There have been 358 total cases performed, 240 of which were hand cases. This included washout of hand wounds (n = 87), tendon repair (n = 54) including a single tendon transfer, fracture pinning (n = 33), amputations (n = 24), trigger finger repair (n = 10), nerve repair (n = 6), congenital hand surgery (n = 4), and other (n = 22). Cost savings per case in the procedure room ranges from 500 cedis (US $100) to 2000 cedis (US $400). CONCLUSIONS: The simple procedure room runs more efficiently and is less costly compared with the main operating rooms. Although the case volume has increased surgical capacity significantly, costs to the hospital and patient have decreased. The hospital is reimbursed in a timely fashion for the procedures directly by the patient using this technique. The creation of a single procedure room for wide-awake local anesthesia no tourniquet hand surgery has helped address the issues of inadequate operating room space, time, and expense in resource-constrained Ghana.",2020,NA,Ann Plast Surg,84,4,385-389,32118629,10.1097/sap.0000000000002196,14360,#3734,Holoyda 2020,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-20 23:36:05)(Select): Doctors were trained to carry out surgeries, which improved surgical capacity; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-20 23:35:16)(Select): Congenital conditions were managed with reconstructive surgery;",Access to Healthcare; Anesthesia; Barriers to Care; Surgical Capacity,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery in Zambia: Epidemiology of 16 Years of Practice,"Jovic, G.; Corlew, D.; Bowman, K.

Of the 1112 patients, 86.1% were reported to have cleft lip alone, 10.5% had cleft lip and palate, and 3.4% cleft palate alone. Despite this, only 5.3% of patients underwent surgical repair of cleft palate. CONCLUSIONS: Multiple factors including malnutrition, risk of bleeding, procedural complexity, and cosmetic results may contribute to the distribution of procedures performed where most cleft palates are not treated. Based on previously published estimates, unmet needs and social burden of cleft lip and palate are high in the DRC.",2020,NA,Cleft Palate Craniofac J,57,11,1314-1319,32787585,10.1177/1055665620947604,13520,#4170,Kalisya 2020,NA,Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care; Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Patterns of congenital malformations and barriers to care in eastern democratic republic of congo,"Kalisya, L. M.; Nyavandu, K.; Machumu, B.; Kwiratuwe, S.; Rej, P. H.","An increase of congenital anomalies in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been reported. Congenital malformations (CMs) are not uncommon among newborns and, if left untreated, can contribute to increased neonate morbidity and mortality. Methods Medical records of all individuals admitted with a diagnosed CM to HEAL Africa Teaching Hospital (Goma, DRC) from 2002 to 2014 (n=1301) were reviewed. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics to summarize chart records, and inferential statistics to investigate significant barriers to earlier treatment. Results Since 2012, the number of patients treated each year for CMs has increased by over 200% compared to the average annual number of cases treated from 2002-2011. Though delayed presentation of patients to HEAL Hospital was very obvious, with an average age of 8.2 years. We find that patient age has been significantly decreasing (p=0.037) over time. The average distance separating patients from HEAL Hospital was 178 km, with approximately one third living 350 km or further from the treatment center. Distance is the most significant (p=3.33x10<sup>-6</sup> ) barrier to earlier treatment. When controlling for an interaction between gender and the use of mercy funds, we also find that female patients are at a significant (p=1.04x10<sup>-3</sup> ) disadvantage to undergo earlier corrective surgery. This disadvantage is further illustrated by our finding that 89% of women and girls, and over 81% of all patients, required mercy funds to cover the cost of surgery in 2014. Lastly, the mortality rate for surgery was low and averaged less than 1.0%. Conclusion Despite a formal end to the war in 2009, and an overall increase in individuals undergoing corrective surgery, distance, poverty, and gender are still massive barriers to CM care at HEAL Hospital, Goma, DRC. We find that patients have been successfully treated earlier by HEAL, although the average age of CM correction in 2014 (4.9 years) is still above average for Sub-Saharan Africa. Thus, we advocate for further funding from the National Government and international health agencies to enable continued treatment of CMs in rural residents of the eastern DRC. Distance, the most significant barrier to care can be mitigated by the implementation of additional mobile clinics and the construction of regional surgery centers along with the associated hiring of surgeons trained in CM repair.",2015,NA,PLoS ONE,10,7,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0132362,20215,#4171,Kalisya 2015,NA,Barriers to Care; Congenital Malformations,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Global Prevalence and Burden of Orofacial Clefts: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019,"Kantar, R. S.; Hamdan, U. S.; Muller, J. N.; Hemal, K.; Younan, R. A.; Haddad, M.; Melhem, A. M.; Griot, Jpwd; Breugem, C. C.; Mokdad, A. H.","Orofacial clefts, in particular cleft lip and cleft palate, are among the most common congenital anomalies. Despite guidelines recommending early surgical correction, a global backlog of untreated patients persists. This has made orofacial clefts an attractive target for global cleft care initiatives. The most recent global burden of orofacial clefts was estimated to be 529,758.92 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval: 362,492.88-798,419.69 disability-adjusted life years), whereas the global prevalence of orofacial clefts was estimated to be 4.6 million (95% uncertainty interval: 3.8-5.7 million). An inverse relationship exists between the Sociodemographic Index and the burden of orofacial clefts. Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East/North Africa, and South Asia are the regions carrying the most significant burden of orofacial clefts.

Methods This is a descriptive and analytical cross-sectional study carried out among the practitioners of all the resuscitation departments of the CHU Sylvanus Olympio in Lomé. Results The caregivers were divided into 11 physicians, 9 medical interns, 7 senior anaesthesia technicians, 1 resuscitation anaesthesia master, 50 state nurses, 1 masseur and physiotherapist. 35 (44.30%) had a high level of emotional exhaustion. Burn out was found in 69.60% of caregivers, of whom 17 (21.50%) had a moderate burnout and 3 (3.80%), a high level of burn out. The causes significantly related to the occurrence of burn out were: lack of resources (diagnostic and therapeutic tools) (p=0.00005), reduced staff size (p=0.00004), poor organisation of the service (p=0.0004).

A cohort of pediatric injury patients from a hospital-based trauma registry in Northern Tanzania,"Keating, E. M.; Sakita, F.; Mmbaga, B. T.; Nkini, G.; Amiri, I.; Tsosie, C.; Fino, N.; Watt, M. H.; Staton, C. A.","Introduction: Pediatric injuries in low- and middle-income countries are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Implementing hospital-based trauma registries can reduce the knowledge gap in both hospital care and patient outcomes and lead to quality improvement initiatives. The goal of this study was to create a pediatric trauma registry to provide insight into the epidemiology, outcomes, and factors associated with poor outcomes in injured children. Methods: This was a prospective observational study in which a pediatric trauma registry was implemented at a large zonal referral hospital in Northern Tanzania. Data included demographics, hospital-based care, and outcomes including morbidity and mortality. Data were input into REDCap© and analyzed using ANOVA and Chi-squared tests in SAS(Version 9.4)©. Results: 365 patients were enrolled in the registry from November 2020 to October 2021. The majority were males (n=240, 65.8%). Most were children 0–5 years (41.7%, n=152), 34.5% (n=126) were 6–11 years, and 23.8% (n=87) were 12–17 years. The leading causes of pediatric injuries were falls (n=137, 37.5%) and road traffic injuries (n=125, 34.5%). The mortality rate was 8.2% (n=30). Of the in-hospital deaths, 43.3% were children with burn injuries who also had a higher odds of mortality than children with other injuries (OR 8.72, p<0.001). The factors associated with in-hospital mortality and morbidity were vital sign abnormalities, burn severity, abnormal Glasgow Coma Score, and ICU admission. Conclusion: The mortality rate of injured children in our cohort was high, especially in children with burn injuries. In order to reduce morbidity and mortality, interventions should be prioritized that focus on pediatric injured patients that present with abnormal vital signs, altered mental status, and severe burns.

A cross-sectional survey of emergency and essential surgical care capacity among hospitals with high trauma burden in a Central African country,"Kouo-Ngamby, M.; Dissak-Delon, F. N.; Feldhaus, I.; Juillard, C.; Stevens, K. A.; Ekeke-Monono, M.","BACKGROUND: As the overwhelming surgical burden of injury and disease steadily increases, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries, adequate surgical and trauma care systems are essential. Yet, little is known about the emergency and essential surgical care (EESC) capacity of facilities in many African countries. The objective of this study was to assess the EESC capacity in different types of hospitals across Cameroon. METHODS: This cross-sectional survey used the WHO Tool for Situational Analysis to Assess EESC, investigating four key areas: infrastructure, human resources, interventions, and equipment and supplies. Twelve hospitals were surveyed between August and September 2009. Facilities were conveniently sampled based on proximity to road traffic and sociodemographic composition of population served in four regions of Cameroon. To complete the survey, investigators interviewed heads of facilities, medical advisors, and nursing officers and consulted hospital records and statistics at each facility. RESULTS: Seven district hospitals, two regional hospitals, two general hospitals, and one missionary hospital completed the survey. Infrastructure for EESC was generally inadequate with the largest gaps in availability of oxygen concentrator supply, an on-site blood bank, and pain relief management guidelines. Human resources were scarce with a combined total of six qualified surgeons, seven qualified obstetrician/gynecologists, and no anesthesiologists at district, regional, and missionary hospitals. Of 35 surgical interventions, 16 were provided by all hospitals. District hospitals reported referring patients for 22 interventions. Only nine of the 67 pieces of equipment were available at all hospitals for all patients all of the time. CONCLUSIONS: Severe shortages highlighted by this survey demonstrate the significant gaps in capacity of hospitals to deliver EESC and effectively address the increasing surgical burden of disease and injury in Cameroon. This data provides a foundation for evidence-based decision-making surrounding appropriate allocation and provision of resources for adequate EESC in the country.",2015,NA,BMC Health Serv Res,15,NA,478,26496762,10.1186/s12913-015-1147-y,14348,#4656,Kouo-Ngamby 2015,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-11 22:30:22)(Select): great breakdown of surgical capacity. also includes procedures; referral patterns;,Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Assessment of pediatric surgery capacity at government hospitals in Sierra Leone,"Kushner, A. L.; Groen, R. S.; Kamara, T. B.; Dixon-Cole, R.; Daoh, K. S.; Kingham, T. P.; Nwomeh, B. C.","Traditionally, efforts to reduce child mortality in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have focused on infectious diseases. However, surgical care is increasingly seen as an important component of primary health care. To understand the baseline surgical capacity in LMICs, a number of studies have recently been published, but none has focused on pediatric surgery. The Surgeons OverSeas (SOS) Personnel, Infrastructure, Procedures, Equipment and Supplies (PIPES) survey was used to collect surgical capacity data from government hospitals in Sierra Leone. The data were analyzed specifically to identify baseline needs for pediatric surgery. Nine hospitals were assessed, and all had a functioning laboratory to test blood and urine and were capable of undertaking resuscitation, suturing, wound débridement, incision and drainage of an abscess, appendectomy, and male circumcision. However, in only 67 % could a pediatric hernia repair be performed, and in none were more complex procedures such as cleft lip and clubfoot repairs performed. Fewer than 50 % of facilities had sufficient gloves, nasogastric tubes, intravenous cannulas, syringes, needles, sutures, urinary catheters, infusion sets, anesthesia machines, or compressed oxygen.

Club foot treatment in Malawi - A public health approach,"Lavy, C. B. D.; Mannion, S. J.; Mkandawire, N. C.; Tindall, A.; Steinlechner, C.; Chimangeni, S.; Chipofya, E.","Purpose. Malawi is a very poor country with a current population of 12 million people and very few orthopaedic surgeons or physiotherapists. An estimated 1125 babies are born per year with club foot. If these feet are not corrected early, then severe deformity can develop, requiring complex surgery. A task force was established to address this problem using locally available resources. Methods. A nationwide early manipulation programme was set up using the Ponseti technique, and a club foot clinic established in each of Malawi's 25 health districts. One year later the clinics were reviewed. Results. Twenty out of the 25 clinics originally established were stillactive, and over one year had seen a total of 342 patients. Adequate records existed for 307 patients, of whom 193 were male and 114 female (ratio 1.7:1). A total of 175 patients had bilateral club foot and 132 were unilateral (ratio 1.3:1) giving a total of 482 club feet; 327 of the 482 feet were corrected to a plantigrade position. Most clinics had problems with supply of materials. Many patients failed to attend the full course of treatment. Conclusions. Overall the establishment of a nationwide club foot treatment programme was of benefit to a large number of children with club feet and their families. In a poor country with many demands on health funding many challenges remain. The supply of plaster of Paris and splints was inadequate, clinic staff felt isolated, and patient compliance was limited by many factors which need further research.",2007,NA,Disability and Rehabilitation,29,11-12,857-862,NA,10.1080/09638280701240169,22273,#4855,Lavy 2007,NA,Barriers to Care; Congenital Malformations; Disabling Pathologies,Access & Barriers,Access & Barriers,Yes
Day-care plastic surgery in Nigeria: Coping with limited resources,"Legbo, J. N.; Opara, W. Ek","Background: The main problems facing acute surgical services in most countries are shortages of resources and finance, and long waiting lists. The concept of day-care surgery has been well established since the early nineties. Since then, enthusiasts have also indicated that day-care surgery represents a safe, cost-effective and efficient practice. Methods: A 3-year retrospective analysis of all day-care plastic surgical cases undertaken in the unit from January 2001 to December 2003 at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University Teaching Hospital, Sokoto. Folders of such patients were obtained from the hospital's medical records department. The information obtained was analyzed for demographic data, surgical problems, type of anaesthesia and postoperative complications. Results: A total of 148 procedures were carried out in 137 patients. This represented 37.2% of all procedures done and 36.5% of all patients treated within the same period in the unit. The ages ranged between 2 weeks and 58 years (mean = 23.1 years). There were 66 males and 71 females, giving a male: female ratio of 1:1.1. The most frequently performed procedure was lipomectomy (11.7%), followed by biopsy of skin tumours (10.9%), incision of tongue tie (10.2%), excision of breast lump (9.5%), reconstruction of facial structures (8.8%), ganglionectomy (8.0%) and others. The anaesthesia, used was loco-regional with lignocaine in 92(67.2%) patients, intravenous ketamine in 41(29.9%) patients and inhalation anaesthetics in the remaining 4 (2.9%). postoperative complications were observed in 13 (9.5%) patients, the commonest of which was wound infection (8.0%), followed by bleeding (5.1%), pain (5.1%) and haematoma (2.9%). Readmission rate was 3.6%, mainly due to bleeding and delayed recovery from anaesthesia. Neither significant wound disruption nor mortality was recorded.

Methods: Online survey covering human resources, infrastructure, and medical equipment of burn centers as well as perceived challenges and points for improvement. The survey was distributed in English and French via snowball method. Descriptive statistics and AI-based technique random forest analysis was applied to identify determinants for a reduction of the reported mortality rate. Results: 271 questionnaires from 237 cities in 40 African countries were analyzed. 222 (81.9 %) from countries with a very low Human Development Index (HDI) (4th quartile). The majority (154, 56.8 %) of all responses were from tertiary health care facilities. In only 18.8 % (n = 51) therapy was free of charge for the patients.

A separate burn ward was available in 94 (34.7 %) centers. Regular skin grafting was performed in 165 (39.1 %) centers. Random forest-based analysis revealed a significant association between HDI (feature importance: 0.38) and mortality. The most important reason for poor outcome was perceived late presentation (212 institutions, 78.2 %). The greatest perceived potential for improvement was introduction of intensive care units (229 institutions, 84.5 %), and prevention or education (227 institutions, 83.7 %).

Perspectives on the state of cleft lip and cleft palate patient care in Africa,"Liu, R. H.; Manana, W.; Tollefson, T. T.; Ntirenganya, F.; Shaye, D. A.","PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Patients with cleft lip -palate (CLP) experience morbidity and social stigma, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as those of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Delays in treatment secondary either to lack of awareness, skills, equipment and consumables; poor health infrastructure, limited resources or a combination of them, has led to SSA having the highest rates of death and second highest rates of disability-adjusted life years in patients with CLP globally. Here we review current perspectives on the state of comprehensive cleft lip and palate repair in Africa. RECENT FINDINGS: To bridge gaps in government health services, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) have emerged to provide care through short-term surgical interventions (STSIs). These groups can effect change through direct provision of care, whereas others strengthen internal system. However, sustainability is lacking as there continue to be barriers to achieving comprehensive and longitudinal cleft care in SSA, including a lack of awareness of CLP as a treatable condition, prohibitive costs, poor follow-up, and insufficient surgical infrastructure. With dedicated local champions, a comprehensive approach, and reliable partners, establishing sustainable CLP services is possible in countries with limited resources.

"District-level surgery in Uganda: Indications, interventions and perioperative mortality","Löfgren, J.; Kadobera, D.; Forsberg, B. C.; Mulowooza, J.; Wladis, A.; Nordin, P.","Background. The world's poorest 2 billion people, benefit from no more than about 3.5% of the world's operative procedures. The burden of surgical disease is greatest in Africa, where operations could save many lives. Previous facility-based studies have described operative procedure caseloads, but prospective studies investigating interventions, indications and perioperative mortality rates (POMR), are rare. Methods. A prospective, questionnaire-based collection of data on all major and minor operative procedures was undertaken at 2 hospitals in rural Uganda covering 4 and 3 months in 2011, respectively. Data included patient characteristics, indications for the interventions performed, and outcome after surgery. Results. We recorded 2,790 operative procedures on 2,701 patients. The rate of major operative procedures per 100,000 population per year was 225. Patients undergoing major operative procedures (n = 1,051) were mostly women (n = 923; 88%) because most interventions were performed owing to pregnancy-related complications (n = 747; 67%) or gynecologic conditions (n = 114; 10%). General operative interventions registered included herniorrhaphy (n = 103; 9%), exploratory laparotomy (n = 60; 5%), and appendectomy (n = 31; 3%). The POMR for major operative procedures was 1 % (n = 14) and was greatest after exploratory laparotomy (13%; n = 8) and caesarean delivery (1%; n = 4). Most deaths = 16) were a result of sepsis (n = 10-11) or hemorrhage (n = 3-5). Conclusion. The volume of surgery was low relative to the size of the catchment population. The POMR was high.

J.; Fokou, M.; Nguimbous, J. F.; Guifo, M. L.; Bahebeck, J.","BACKGROUND: The proportion of death and disability related to trauma is increasing in Third-World countries. Thoracic trauma is significantly involved, but few data are available on this issue in African countries with specific local conditions. METHODS: The aim of the study is to analyse the diagnosis and management procedures in thoracic trauma in a typical African country. The records of 354 patients admitted to an emergency unit for chest trauma over a 13-year period were retrospectively analysed. RESULTS: The sample included patients with 231 cases of blunt and 123 of penetrating trauma to the chest; their mean age was 41.86 years, and the male:female ratio was 4.2:1. The majority (N=226) of the injuries were sustained in road traffic accidents, and the most common lesions were rib fractures (50.3%) and haemothorax (38.7%). The diagnosis was based on physical examination and standard chest radiographs in most cases. At least one associated lesion was found in 260 (73.45%) patients. The mean injury severity score (ISS) for our patients was 16.39. Most patients were managed conservatively (N=303); thoracotomy was performed mostly on penetrating trauma patients. Morbidity occurred in 49 patients, mainly affecting those treated with thoracic drainage, and 27 patients (7.6%) died. Factors related to mortality were ISS score and association with neurotrauma.

J.; Amar-Zifkin, A.; Baird, R.; Cugno, S.; Poenaru, D.","In low- and lower middle-income countries (LMICs), timely access to primary care following thermal injury is challenging. Children with deep burns often fail to receive specialized burn care until months or years post-injury, thus suffering impairments from hypertrophic scarring or joint and soft tissue contractures. We aimed to examine the correlation between limited access to care following burn injury and long-term disability in children in LMICs and to identify specific factors affecting the occurrence of late burn complications. A systematic literature search was conducted to retrieve articles on pediatric burns in LMICs using Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Global Health, African Index Medicus, and others. Articles were assessed by two reviewers and reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Of 2896 articles initially identified, 103 underwent full-text review and 14 met inclusion criteria. A total of 991 children who developed long-term burn sequelae were included. Time from injury to consultation ranged from a few months to 17 years. Factors associated with late complications included total body surface area burned, burn depth, low socio-economic status, limited infrastructure, perceived inability to pay, lack of awareness of surgical treatment, low level of maternal education, and time elapsed between burn injury and reconstructive surgery.",2020,NA,Burns,46,5,993-1004,31813620,10.1016/j.burns.2019.06.001,13513,#5569,Meng 2020,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-14 01:37:01)(Select): barriers to care; burns;

Factors Contributing to and Reducing Delays in the Provision of Adequate Care in Ghana: A Qualitative Study of Trauma Care Providers,"Mesic, A.; Gyedu, A.; Mehta, K.; Goodman, S. K.; Mock, C.; Quansah, R.; Donkor, P.; Stewart, B.","BACKGROUND: Ghana has a large and growing burden of injury morbidity and mortality. There is a substantial unmet need for trauma surgery, highlighting a need to understand gaps in care. METHODS: We conducted 8 in-depth interviews with trauma care providers (surgeons, nurses, and specialists) at a large teaching hospital to understand factors that contribute to and reduce delays in the provision of adequate trauma care for severely injured patients. The study aimed to understand whether providers thought factors differed between patients that were enrolled in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS) and those that were not. Findings were presented for the third delay (provision of appropriate care) in the Three Delays Framework. RESULTS: Key findings included that most factors contributing delays in the provision of adequate care were related to the costs of care, including for diagnostics, medications, and treatment for patients with and without NHIS subscription. Other notable factors included conflicts between providers, resource constraints, and poor coordination of care at the facility. Factors which reduce delays included advocacy by providers and informal processes for prioritizing critical injuries. CONCLUSION: We recommend facility-level changes including increasing equity in access to trauma and elective surgery through targeted system strengthening efforts (e.g., a scheduled back-up call system for surgeons, anesthetists, other specialists, and nurses; designated operating theatres and staff for emergencies; training of staff), policy changes to simplify the insurance renewal and subscription processes, and future research on the costs and benefits of including diagnostics, medications, and common trauma services into the NHIS benefits package.",2022,NA,World J Surg,46,11,2607-2615,35994075,10.1007/s00268-022-06686-8,14139,#5587,Mesic 2022,"Sabina Rodriguez (2025-01-30 09:26:24)(Select): Qualitative study on the identified delays by staff of hospital (surgeons, nurses...)

Challenges in developing paediatric surgery in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Mhando, S.; Lyamuya, S.; Lakhoo, K.","The aim of the present study is to report on the difficulties in developing paediatric surgery in a teaching hospital in Tanzania. The methods are as follows: (1) information on the demography and health services of Tanzania were obtained from the Ministry of Health and the 1998 consensus report; (2) hospital data was obtained from the Medical Director's Office and analysed; (3) the current delivery of surgical services for children at the Tumaini University Hospital and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) is reported; (4) the local, national and international support for the development of surgical services for children is noted; (5) the teaching, training and research programmes are proposed. The results showed that (1) Tanzania has a population of 31 million with a total health expenditure of 10%. There is 1 doctor for 23,000 inhabitants and 1 hospital bed per 940. The infant mortality is 173 per thousand life births. (2) The bed capacity at KCMC is 500 with a staff of 40 consultants, 294 nurses, 246 health attendants and 38 clinical officers. (3) Forty-two percent of admissions to the surgical ward and 50% of surgical outpatients are children. Surgical newborns are cared for in the special care baby unit and there are no neonatal or paediatric ventilators. (4) Support to develop surgical services for children has been pledged for locally, nationally and internationally; however, delivery of the service has not had the equivalent momentum.

Economic and Social Costs of Noma: Design and Application of an Estimation Model to Niger and Burkina Faso,"Mpinga, E. K.; Srour, M. L.; Moussa, M. A.; Dupuis, M.; Kagoné, M.; Grema, M. S. M.; Zacharie, N. B.; Baratti-Mayer, D.","BACKGROUND: While noma affects hundreds of thousands of children every year, taking their lives, disfiguring them and leaving them permanently disabled, the economic and social costs of the disease have not been previously estimated. An understanding of the nature and levels of these costs is much needed to formulate and implement strategies for the prevention and control of this disease, or to mitigate its burden. The objectives of our study were to develop a model for estimating the economic and social costs of noma and to provide estimates by applying this model to the specific contexts of two countries in the ""noma belt"", namely Burkina Faso and Niger. METHODS: Three main approaches were used. The estimation of prevalence levels of potential noma cases and of cases that should receive and actually do receive medical care was carried out using a literature review. The documentary approach made it possible to estimate the direct costs of noma by analyzing the database of a non-governmental organization operating in this field and present in both countries. Indirect costs were estimated using the human capital method and the cost component analysis technique. RESULTS: The direct costs of care and management of noma survivors amount to approximately USD 30 million per year in Burkina Faso, compared to approximately USD 31 million in Niger. They mainly include costs for medical treatment, surgery, hospital stays, physiological care, psychological care, social assistance, schooling, vocational training and care abroad. Indirect costs are estimated at around 20 million in lost production costs in Burkina and around 16 million in Niger. Costs related to premature deaths are estimated at more than USD 3.5 billion in Burkina Faso and USD 3 billion in Niger. Finally, the costs to survivors who are unable to marry are around USD 13.4 million in Burkina and around USD 15 million in Niger. Intangible costs were not calculated. CONCLUSIONS: The neglect of noma and inaction in terms of prevention and control of the disease have enormous economic and social costs for households, communities and states. Future studies of this kind are necessary and useful to raise awareness and eradicate this disease, which impacts the health and well-being of children and results in lifelong suffering and severe economic and social costs to survivors and their families.",2022,NA,Trop Med Infect Dis,7,7,NA,35878131,10.3390/tropicalmed7070119,15072,#5864,Mpinga 2022,NA,Cost; Noma,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
A plastic and reconstructive surgery landscape assessment of Malawi: a scoping review of Malawian literature,"Msokera, C.; Xepoleas, M.; Collier, Z. J.; Naidu, P.; Magee, W., 3rd","BACKGROUND: Plastic and reconstructive surgery (PRS) remains highly relevant to the unmet need for surgery in Malawi. Better understanding the current PRS landscape and its barriers may help address some of these challenges. This scoping review aimed to describe: (1) the scope and focus of the PRS literature being produced in Malawi and (2) the challenges, deficits, and barriers to providing accessible, high-quality PRS in Malawi. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted on four databases (SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE) from inception through September 1, 2020 following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 3852 articles, of which 31 were included that examined the burden of PRS-related conditions in Malawi. Of these 31 articles, 25 primarily discussed burn-related care. Burns injuries have a high mortality rate; between 27 and 75% in the studies. The literature revealed that there are only two burn units nationally with one PRS specialist in each unit, compounded by a lack of interest in PRS specialization by Malawian medical students. Congenital anomalies were the only other PRS-related condition examined and reported in the literature, accounting for 23% of all pediatric surgeries in tertiary facilities. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to increase the country's capacity to handle burn reconstruction and other PRS-related conditions to reduce overall morbidity and mortality.

Non-Obstetric Surgical Care at Three Rural District Hospitals in Rwanda: More Human Capacity and Surgical Equipment May Increase Operative Care,"Muhirwa, E.; Habiyakare, C.; Hedt-Gauthier, B. L.; Odhiambo, J.; Maine, R.; Gupta, N.; Toma, G.; Nkurunziza, T.; Mpunga, T.; Mukankusi, J.; Riviello, R.","BACKGROUND: Most mortality attributable to surgical emergencies occurs in low- and middle-income countries. District hospitals, which serve as the first-level surgical facility in rural sub-Saharan Africa, are often challenged with limited surgical capacity. This study describes the presentation, management, and outcomes of non-obstetric surgical patients at district hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: This study included patients seeking non-obstetric surgical care at three district hospitals in rural Rwanda in 2013. Demographics, surgical conditions, patient care, and outcomes are described; operative and non-operative management were stratified by hospitals and differences assessed using Fisher's exact test. RESULTS: Of the 2660 patients who sought surgical care at the three hospitals, most were males (60.7 %). Many (42.6 %) were injured and 34.7 % of injuries were through road traffic crashes. Of presenting patients, 25.3 % had an operation, with patients presenting to Butaro District Hospital significantly more likely to receive surgery (57.0 %, p < 0.001). General practitioners performed nearly all operations at Kirehe and Rwinkwavu District Hospitals (98.0 and 100.0 %, respectively), but surgeons performed 90.6 % of the operations at Butaro District Hospital. For outcomes, 39.5 % of all patients were discharged without an operation, 21.1 % received surgery and were discharged, and 21.1 % were referred to tertiary facilities for surgical care. CONCLUSION: Significantly more patients in Butaro, the only site with a surgeon on staff and stronger surgical infrastructure, received surgery.

Designing a contextually appropriate surgical training program in low-resource settings: the Botswana experience,"Mutabdzic, D.; Bedada, A. G.; Bakanisi, B.; Motsumi, J.; Azzie, G.","BACKGROUND: The global burden of surgical disease and severe shortage of trained surgeons around the world are now widely recognized. The greatest challenge in improving access to surgical care lies in sub-Saharan Africa, where the number of surgeons per population is lowest. One part of the solution may be to create programs to train surgeons locally. We present our experience with an approach to designing a contextually appropriate surgical curriculum in Botswana. METHODS: Surgical logbooks from the largest tertiary care center in Botswana, dating from 2004 through 2010, were analyzed to yield total case numbers within clearly defined categories. Case numbers and local surgical opinion were combined to design a contextually relevant curriculum, with the Surgical Council on Resident Education curriculum as a template. RESULTS: Logbook analysis revealed that general surgeons in Botswana manage burns and perform a large number of skin grafts and extremity amputations. However, they perform few colonoscopies and complex laparoscopic procedures. The new curriculum included greater emphasis on surgical subspecialty procedures and surgical management of locally relevant conditions, such as the complications of infectious diseases. Less emphasis was placed on management of uncommon conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease.

Referral of Burn Patients in the Absence of Guidelines: A Rwandan Study,"Nezerwa, Y.; Miranda, E.; Velin, L.; Shyaka, I.; Mukagaju, F.; Busomoke, F.; Nsanzimana, J. D.; Mukeshimana, M.; Mushimiyimana, D.; Mukambasabire, B.; Uwimana, L.; Ntirenganya, F.; Furaha, C.; Riviello, R.; Pompermaier, L.","INTRODUCTION: The management of severe burns and pediatric burns requires an organized system of care delivery, which includes referral guidelines. In Rwanda, the burn unit at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali (CHUK) is the only dedicated burn unit in the country and admits patients of all ages referred from the other provinces. However, since there are no official referral guidelines, it is unknown whether patients with burns are appropriately referred. This study aims to analyze referral patterns among burn patients admitted at the CHUK burn unit and their adherence to the referral criteria listed by the American Burn Association (ABA), comparing patients transferred to the burn unit from facilities within Kigali and those referred from facilities outside Kigali. METHODS: This retrospective study included all patients with acute burns admitted to the CHUK burn unit with data available on the province of origin from 2005 to 2019. Patients with burns younger than 16 y were defined as pediatric burns, as per the CHUK routines. Characteristics of all burns referred from a facility within Kigali (Pat-K) and facilities outside Kigali (Pat-O) were compared using Fisher's exact test for categorical variables or Wilcoxon rank-sum test for continuous variables. The adherence to ABA referral criteria was assessed for variables with available data, which were total burnt surface area %, burn thickness, cause of burn, and age. RESULTS: The study population consisted of 1093 patients, of which 1064 had data regarding if they were referred from other facilities to CHUK. Overall, the median age was 3 y (2-16 y), with Pat-O being older than Pat-K (P < 0.001). Scalds were the dominant cause of injury in both groups; flame was more common among Pat-O than among Pat-K (in 25.5% versus 10.6%, P < 0.01). Burns of larger size and depth were more common among Pat-O, as compared to the Pat-K group [median total burnt surface area % = 19% versus 15.5%, respectively (P < 0.001); presence of full-thickness burns = 55.6% versus 29.7 %, respectively (P < 0.001)]. Hospitalization was longer and in-hospital mortality higher in Pat-O than in Pat-K [LOS = 42 d (interquartile range 11-164) versus 28 d (interquartile range 9-132), P < 0.05; in-hospital mortality = 18.9% versus 10.1%, P < 0.001]. Among Pat-O, 85% had characteristics that mirrored one or more of the analyzed ABA criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Although there are no clear guidelines, referral patterns indicate that patients are being appropriately referred for specialized burn care in Rwanda. Compared to patients from Kigali, rural patients had larger and more severe injuries, needed more surgical interventions, and had worse outcomes. Most of referred patients matched criteria listed among international referral guidelines. However, the statement of national referral criteria is essential to improve timely access to adequate care.",2022,NA,J Surg Res,278,NA,216-222,35636196,10.1016/j.jss.2022.04.066,13914,#6183,Nezerwa 2022,NA,Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care; Burns,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes

Firearm injuries at selected hospitals in Kenya,"Njeru, E. K.; Mutiso, V. M.; Saidi, H.; Mak'Anyengo, K.; Gakuru, J. N.","Background: The burden of injury in low-income countries is greater than in highincome countries, but injury documentation and prevention policies are inadequate. The who, where and how of firearm injuries in Kenya has received little attention. Objective: This study describes the epidemiology of small and light firearm injuries to highlight the problem and stimulate further methodologically and scientifically sound research in the area. Method: This retrospective study involved abstracting socio-demographic data, injury mechanism, intention, resources consumed and outcome information from case notes in the records departments of two major health facilities in Nairobi. Results: Eight hundred and fifty two hospital admissions due to gun-shot injuries were recorded between 1997 - 2002 (average, 142 per year) representing 1.8% of all injury admissions, and 0.2% of total admissions at the two hospitals. There were 10 times more male admissions and 89.9% of those involved were in the 15-44 year age group. Six hundred and twenty nine (85.9%) of the admissions were as a result of intentional injuries (assaults) while 101 (13.8%) were as a result of unintentional injuries. Fourty two (5%) patients died in hospital while 800 (94.5%) were discharged home. The burden on health care facilities included a total of 15,392 ward days for 841 patients whose records were available and a total of 144 ICU days for 19 patients. Seven hundred and eighty four (92.9%) patients underwent some form of surgery, mostly limb surgical toilet with wound excision/debridement.

Methods: The medical records of patients who presented with FG from February 2012 to December 2019 were reviewed. Of interest were age of patient, vital signs at presentation, site of gangrene, duration of hospital admission, and management interventions deployed. Analysis was with SPSS® version 21. Results: Twenty-three of 28 medical records could be analyzed. Median Fournier’s Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) was 5 (IQR:3–10), the median Uludag-FGSI (UFGSI) was 7 (IQR:4–14). In 82.6%, the scrotum was the site of onset; in 8.7%, the lesion had spread beyond the pelvis. Diabetes mellitus (30.4%), HIV infection (13.0%) and nephropathy (17.4%) were identified co-morbidities. There were 2.4 ± 1.0 debridement sessions and 1.5 ± 1.3 transfused units of blood per patient. In 60.9%, the wound edges were undermined and apposed; in 17.4%, split skin grafting or fascio-cutaneous flap cover was deployed. In 17.4%, satisfactory wound closure needed more than 1 theater session. Mean duration of hospital admission was 51.4 ± 19.4 days. No mortality was recorded.

Trauma care and referral patterns in Rwanda: implications for trauma system development,"Ntakiyiruta, G.; Wong, E. G.; Rousseau, M. C.; Ruhungande, L.; Kushner, A. L.; Liberman, A. S.; Khwaja, K.; Dakermandji, M.; Wilson, M.; Razek, T.; Kyamanywa, P.; Deckelbaum, D. L.","Background Trauma remains a leading cause of death worldwide. The development of trauma systems in low-resource settings may be of benefit. The objective of this study was to describe operative procedures performed for trauma at a tertiary care facility in Kigali, Rwanda, and to evaluate geographical variations and referral patterns of trauma care. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all prospectively collected operative cases performed at the largest referral hospital in Rwanda, the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Kigali (CHUK), between June 1 and Dec. 1, 2011, for injury-related diagnoses. We used the Pearson (2) and Fisher exact tests to compare cases arising from within Kigali to those transferred from other provinces. Geospatial analyses were also performed to further elucidate transfer patterns. Results Over the 6-month study period, 2758 surgical interventions were performed at the CHUK. Of these, 653 (23.7%) were for trauma. Most patients resided outside of Kigali city, with 337 (58.0%) patients transferred from other provinces and 244 (42.0%) from within Kigali. Most trauma procedures were orthopedic (489 [84.2%]), although general surgery procedures represented a higher proportion of trauma surgeries in patients from other provinces than in patients from within Kigali (28 of 337 [8.3%] v. 10 of 244 [4.1%]). Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the first study to highlight geographical variations in access to trauma care in a low-income country and the first description of trauma procedures at a referral centre in Rwanda. Future efforts should focus on maturing prehospital and interfacility transport systems, strengthening district hospitals and further supporting referral institutions.

"Epidemiology and cost of pediatric injury in Yaoundé, Cameroon: a prospective study","Nwanna-Nzewunwa, O.; Ngamby, M. K.; Cox, J.; Feldhaus, I.; Motwani, G.; Monono, M. E.; Etoundi, G. A.; Dicker, R. A.; Hyder, A. A.; Juillard, C.","PURPOSE: Unintentional injury is the leading cause of death among children aged 10-19 years and over 95% of injury deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). As patterns of injury in the pediatric population may differ from those in adults, risks specific to children in LMICs need to be identified for effective injury prevention and treatment. This study explores patterns of pediatric injury epidemiology and cost in Yaoundé, Cameroon to inform injury prevention and resource allocation. METHODS: Pediatric (age < 20 years) trauma patient data were collected at the emergency department (ED) of Central Hospital of Yaoundé (CHY) from April through October 2009. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were used to explore injury patterns and relationships between variables. Regression analyses were conducted to identify predictors of receiving surgical care. RESULTS: Children comprised 19% (544) of trauma cases. About 54% suffered road traffic injuries (RTIs), which mostly affected the limbs and pelvis (37.3%). Half the RTI victims were pedestrians. Transportation to CHY was primarily by taxi or bus (69.4%) and a preponderance (71.1%) of the severely and profoundly injured patients used this method of transport. Major or minor surgical intervention was necessary for 17.9% and 20.8% of patients, respectively. Patients with an estimated injury severity score ≥ 9 (33.2%) were more likely to need surgery (p < 0.01). The median ED cost of pediatric trauma care was USD12.71 [IQR 12.71, 23.30].

Hospitalized for poverty: orthopaedic discharge delays due to financial hardship in a tertiary hospital in Northern Tanzania,"Obayemi, J. E.; Card, E. B.; Shirima, O.; Premkumar, A.; Massawe, H.; Sheth, N. P.","BACKGROUND: Musculoskeletal injury contributes significantly to the burden of disease in Tanzania and other LMICs. For hospitals to cope financially with this burden, they often mandate that patients pay their entire hospital bill before leaving the hospital. This creates a phenomenon of patients who remain hospitalized solely due to financial hardship. This study aims to characterize the impact of this policy on patients and hospital systems in resource-limited settings. METHODS: A mixed-methods study using retrospective medical record review and semi-structured interviews was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Moshi, Tanzania. Information regarding patient demographics, injury type, days spent in the ward after medical clearance for discharge, and hospital invoices were collected and analyzed for orthopaedic patients treated from November 2016 to June 2017. RESULTS: 346 of the 867 orthopaedic patients (39.9%) treated during this time period were found to have spent additional days in the hospital due to their inability to pay their hospital bill. Of these patients, 72 patient charts were analyzed. These 72 patients spent an average of 9 additional days in the hospital due to financial hardship (range: 1-64 days; interquartile range: 2-10.5 days). They spent an average of 112,958 Tanzanian Shillings (TSH) to pay for services received following medical clearance for discharge, representing 12.3% of the average total bill (916,840 TSH). 646 hospital bed-days were spent on these 72 patients when they no longer clinically required hospitalization. 7 (9.7%) patients eloped from the hospital without paying and 24 (33.3%) received financial assistance from the hospital's social welfare office. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients do not have the financial capacity to pay hospital fees prior to discharge. This reality has added significantly to these patients' overall financial hardship and has taken hundreds of bed-days from other critically ill patients. This single-institution, cross-sectional study provides a deeper understanding of this phenomenon and highlights the need for changes in the healthcare payment structure in Tanzania and other comparable settings.",2022,NA,Glob Health Res Policy,7,1,31,36050802,10.1186/s41256-022-00265-z,14387,#6376,Obayemi 2022,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-15 00:51:52)(Select): forcuses on focuses on musculoskeletal injuries, including fractures and osteomyelitis (reconstructive surgical conditions), Financial hardship which is a significant barrier, with policies requiring patients to pay their hospital bills before discharge, leading to prolonged hospital stays;",Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Cleft Surgery Service at National Orthopaedic Hospital Enugu: impact of free treatment programme,"Onah, II; Ezinwa, C. O.","INTRODUCTION: Previous reports on free surgeries have tended to focus on the numbers of patients treated. Little has been documented on the impact on training hence this report. Such grants should positively impact training, patient outcome and volume of patients. METHODS: A retrospective review of all cleft surgeries carried out two years before and after the commencement of free surgical treatment at the hospital (from November 2004 to October 2008) was undertaken. The demographics were studied for both primary and revisional surgeries. The primary surgeons were noted. Excluded from the study are procedures to remove sutures. Simple arithmetic analysis was used. RESULTS: Seventy-three cleft procedures had been carried out before, while 168 procedures were carried out after October 2006. Eight patients aged over 15 years had lip repairs before while 42 patients over 15 years had lip repair after commencement. Fourteen procedures were carried out by three trainee surgeons before; while 29 procedures were carried out by nine trainees after October 2006.

Towards effective Ponseti clubfoot care: the Uganda Sustainable Clubfoot Care Project,"Pirani, S.; Naddumba, E.; Mathias, R.; Konde-Lule, J.; Penny, J. N.; Beyeza, T.; Mbonye, B.; Amone, J.; Franceschi, F.","Neglected clubfoot is common, disabling, and contributes to poverty in developing nations. The Ponseti clubfoot treatment has high efficacy in correcting the clubfoot deformity in ideal conditions but is demanding on parents and on developing nations' healthcare systems. Its effectiveness and the best method of care delivery remain unknown in this context. The 6-year Uganda Sustainable Clubfoot Care Project (USCCP) aims to build the Ugandan healthcare system's capacity to treat children with the Ponseti method and assess its effectiveness. We describe the Project and its achievements to date (March 2008). The Ugandan Ministry of Health has approved the Ponseti method as the preferred treatment for congenital clubfoot in all its hospitals. USCCP has trained 798 healthcare professionals to identify and treat foot deformities at birth. Ponseti clubfoot care is now available in 21 hospitals; in 2006-2007, 872 children with clubfeet were seen. USCCP-designed teaching modules on clubfoot and the Ponseti method are in use at two medical and three paramedical schools. 1152 students in various health disciplines have benefited. USCCP surveys have (1) determined the incidence of clubfoot in Uganda as 1.2 per 1000 live births, (2) gained knowledge surrounding attitudes, beliefs, and practices about clubfoot across different regions, and (3) identified barriers to adherence to Ponseti treatment protocols.

Getting the job done: analysis of the impact and effectiveness of the SmileTrain program in alleviating the global burden of cleft disease,"Poenaru, D.","BACKGROUND: The study measured the success of SmileTrain, the largest cleft charity globally, in alleviating the global burden of disease (GBD). It was done by estimating averted disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and delayed averted DALYs because of the global backlog in cleft procedures. METHODS: Anonymized data for all procedures in the SmileTrain global database were analyzed by age, sex, country, region, and surgery type. DALYs averted were calculated using life expectancy tables and established and estimated disability weights. The cost-effectiveness analysis used mean SmileTrain procedural disbursement figures. Sensitivity analysis was performed using various cleft incidence rates, life expectancy tables, and disability weights. RESULTS: During 2003-2010 a total of 536,846 operations were performed on 364,467 patients-86 % in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific region. Procedure numbers increased yearly. Mean age at primary surgery-6.2 years (9.8 years in Africa)-remained fairly constant over time in each region. Globally, 2.1-4.7 million DALYs were averted through the operations at a total estimated cost of US$196 M. Mean DALYs per patient were 3.8-9.0, and mean cost per DALY was $72-$134. Total delayed GBD due to advanced age at surgery was 191,000-457,000 DALYs. CONCLUSIONS: Despite an unparalleled number of surgeries performed and yearly increase by one charity, the unmet and delayed averted cleft GBD remains significant in all regions.

This study estimates the DALYs accrued from delayed access to surgical care in two pediatric surgical units in Kenya and Canada. METHODS: Records of operations for 13 congenital health states in a Kenyan and a Canadian hospital were prospectively collected for 2012. DALYs caused by delayed presentation were estimated using disability weights and ideal and actual age at surgery. RESULTS: 1208 first-time procedures in general surgery, neurosurgery, plastic surgery, and urology were included. Delays were longest in general surgery and longer in Kenya than in Canada in all specialties. The longest delays in Kenya were for orchidopexy (72 months) and anorectoplasty (PSARP) (74 months), and in Canada for orchidopexy (40 months). Corresponding total delayed BoD was highest in general surgery and neurosurgery and higher again in Kenya than in Canada (484 cf. 84 DALYs).

The Effect of Surgical Intervention on Pediatric Burn Injury Survival in a Resource-Poor Setting,"Purcell, L. N.; Banda, W.; Williams, B.; Gallaher, J.; Charles, A.","INTRODUCTION: Burns are one of the most common injuries sustained globally. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are disproportionately affected by burn injury morbidity and mortality; African children have the highest burn mortality globally. In high-income countries, early surgical intervention has shown to improve survival. However, when applied to burn victims in LMICs, improved survival in the early excision cohort (≤5 d) was not seen. Therefore, we aimed to determine the magnitude of the effect of surgical intervention on burn injury survival. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a prospectively collected data, utilizing the Kamuzu Central Hospital Burn Database from May 2011 to July 2019, was performed. Pediatric patients (≤12 y) were included. Patients were excluded if they underwent surgical intervention for nonacute burn care management. Bivariate analyses stratifying by type of surgical intervention was performed, comparing demographics, burn characteristics, surgical intervention, and patient mortality. Standardized estimates were adjusted using the inverse-probability of treatment weights to account for confounding. Weighted logistic regression modeling was performed to determine the odds of mortality based on if a patient underwent surgical intervention. RESULTS: During the study, 2364 patients were seen at the Kamuzu Central Hospital, 1785 (75.5%) were children ≤12 y who met inclusion criteria. In the overall cohort, 342 (19.2%) underwent operations, including split-thickness skin graft (n = 196, 57.3%), debridement (n = 116, 33.9%), escharotomy (n = 19, 5.6%), and amputation (n = 1, 0.3%). The surgery cohort was older (4.2 ± 3.1 versus 3.1 ± 2.6 y, P < 0.001) with larger percent total body surface area burns (16%, interquartile range: 10-24 versus 13%, interquartile range: 8-20, P < 0.001) than those who did not have surgery. In the propensity score-weighted logistic regression predicting survival, patients undergoing surgery after burn injury had an increased odds of survival (odds ratio: 5.24, 95% confidence interval: 2.40-11.44, P = 0.003) when compared with patients not undergoing surgery. CONCLUSIONS: In this propensity-weighted analysis, surgical intervention following burn injury increases the odds of survival by a factor of 5.24 when compared with patients not undergoing surgical intervention. Efforts to enhance burn infrastructure to deliver surgical care is imperative to attenuate burn mortality in resource-poor settings.",2020,NA,J Surg Res,253,NA,86-91,32335395,10.1016/j.jss.2020.03.035,13355,#7140,Purcell 2020,NA,Burns,Trauma,Access & Barriers,Yes

Prospective evaluation of anaesthesia adverse events occurring during a surgical mission in Madagascar and the relation to postoperative complications,"Robinson, E.; Couch, S.; White, M.","Currently a significant amount of surgical and anaesthesia care in many low and middle income countries is provided by non-governmental organisations (NGO) and visiting teams [1]. These teams typically rely on a team of international surgeons and anaesthetists volunteering for only a few weeks which makes teamwork and communication challenging and may compromise patient safety because surgical complications in these settings are higher than elsewhere [2]. However, the incidence of anaesthesia adverse events on surgical missions is unknown. We report our experience of 851 anaesthetics in Madagascar with the NGO, Mercy Ships. Methods For 6 months (November 2014-May 2015) we collected data prospectively on anaesthetic adverse events and postoperative complications. Complications were defined based on the US Anesthesia Quality Institute data set and divided into intra-operative, postoperative care unit (PACU), ward and surgical complications. Results A total of 851 surgical cases were undertaken by 33 different anaesthetists from 12 different countries. Of these, 247 (29%) surgical cases were children under 14 years. There were a total of 36 anaesthesia or PACU adverse events in 19 patients. Details are shown in Table 1. Surgical case mix was: maxillofacial 38%; plastic/reconstructive 11%; obstetric fistula 10%; paediatric orthopaedic 6% and general 35%. There were 50 postoperative complications (11 return to hospital, 22 return to OR, and 17 surgical site infections [SSI]). Only one was associated with an anaesthesia adverse event. This was an 8 year old boy who experienced a SSI after a neck contracture release where there was a difficult airway and contamination of the neck wound occurred. Discussion The incidence of anaesthesia adverse events was comparable to published data from Western institutions [3]. Maxillofacial surgery is associated with a higher incidence of airway complications due to the 'shared airway' and airway complications are also more frequent in children anaesthetised by non-specialist paediatric anaesthetists. This is reflected in our data: 16/17 airway complications occurred either in children or in head and neck cases or both. The exception was a 55 year old man undergoing hernia repair who was noted to have regurgitation, but no problems postoperatively. In our organisation the presence of one permanent surgeon and anaesthetist; strict orientation and evaluation procedures; and written guidelines including use of the WHO surgical safety checklist are likely contributing factors to the good safety record.

Low and Middle-Income Countries bear a significant burden of paediatric burn injuries. In Ghana, limited data exists on the prevalence, characteristics and outcomes of paediatric burns. This study provides vital data on the local burden and epidemiology of paediatric burns at Ghana's main burns treatment center. The findings have significant value in informing prevention strategies, allocating resources, and improving quality of paediatric burn care. Study objective: To establish the prevalence and characteristics of paediatric burns injuries in Ghana's leading burn center. Methodology: A retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 662 adult and paediatric patients who presented with burns from all over Ghana between 2020 and 2022. The study encompassed medical records of paediatric burn cases (aged 0–14 years) admitted to the center from January 2020 to December 2022. A purposive sampling technique was used to select cases based on the inclusion criteria and elimination of cases with 20 % missing data. A total of 335 paediatric records were reviewed. Data analytical methods: Descriptive statistics, such as frequencies, mean, percentages were used to establish period prevalence and demographic characteristics of paediatric burns. Chi-square analysis and univariate logistic regression was utilized to explore associations between categorical variables, and predictors of burn outcome. Results: The period prevalence of paediatric burns was found to be 50.6 %. Paediatric burn cases predominantly affected males (57.6 %). Majority of cases fell within the age range of 1 to 5 years (70.1 %). Hot water emerged as the leading cause (58.4 %), whiles superficial partial thickness burns (51.9 %) was the predominant type of burn. Most cases involved burns affecting less than 20 % Total Body Surface Area (59.0 %). Multi-part body injuries were common (87.2 %), with the lower limb being the most affected (25.36 %). The mortality rate was calculated to be 21.0 %. Higher TBSA was a significant predictor of mortality (p < 0.001). Conclusion: This study found a high prevalence of paediatric burns with hot water and foods being the predominant causes. Higher TBSA predicted lower chances of survival.

Epidemiology of Polytrauma at a Teaching Hospital in Northern Ghana: A Cross-Sectional Study,"Seidu, A. S.; Alhassan, A. R.; Buunaaim, Adbi","Background. Polytrauma refers to multiple life-threatening injuries to more than 2 bodily regions with some significant physiologic derangement. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality globally. This study aimed to evaluate the epidemiological profile of polytrauma and outline the distribution of extremity fractures among cases in Northern Ghana. Methods. A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted at the Accident and Emergency Department of Tamale Teaching Hospital. Data were extracted using a data collection tool onto MS Excel, cleaned, and exported onto SPSS version 26 for analysis. Descriptive statistics was used to present data in tables and charts. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to assess whether there was a significant difference in the mean ISS and mean length of stay of the direct causes of death. Results. About 186 out of 5413 attendants to the emergency department were polytrauma, period prevalence of 3.4%. The male-to-female ratio was 1.9 : 1. Young adults (21-40 years) contributed 64% of the participants. The mean age of participants was 32.9 +/- 15.4 years, and the mean ISS was 40.6 +/- 13.1. Road traffic accidents (68.8%) were the most common cause of polytrauma. The mortality was 33.0%. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) was the most common direct cause of mortality (54.1%). There was a significant mean difference (MD) in the length of stay between multiple organ failure (MOF) and TBI (MD = 3.169, 95% C.I. = 0.48-5.86) and between MOF and hemorrhage (MD = 6.212, 95% C.I. = 2.62-9.80). Most fractures were closed (75.3%) and affected the lower limbs (61.5%). Open reduction and internal fixation were the most common surgery for extremity fractures. Conclusion.

Retrospective review of Surgical Availability and Readiness in 8 African countries,"Spiegel, D. A.; Droti, B.; Relan, P.; Hobson, S.; Cherian, M. N.; O'Neill, K.","Objectives: The purpose of this study was to assess surgical availability and readiness in 8 African countries using the WHO's Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) tool. Setting: We analysed data for surgical services, including basic and comprehensive surgery, comprehensive obstetric care, blood transfusion, and infection prevention, obtained from the WHO's SARA surveys in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Mauritania, Benin, Zambia, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo and Togo. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Among the facilities that were expected to offer surgical services (N=3492), there were wide disparities between the countries in the number of facilities per 100 000 population that reported offering basic surgery (1.0-12.1), comprehensive surgery (0.1-0.8), comprehensive obstetric care (0.1-0.8) and blood transfusion (0.1-0.8). Only 0.1-0.3 facilities per 100 000 population had all three bellwether procedures available, namely laparotomy, open fracture management and caesarean section. In all the countries, the facilities that reported offering surgical services generally had a shortage of the necessary items for offering the services and this varied greatly between the countries, with the facilities having on average 27-53% of the items necessary for offering basic surgery, 56-83% for comprehensive surgery, 49-72% for comprehensive obstetric care and 54-80% for blood transfusion. Furthermore, few facilities had all the necessary items present. However, facilities that reported offering surgical services had on average most of the necessary items for the prevention of infection. Conclusions: There are important gaps in the surgical services in the 8 African countries surveyed. Efforts are therefore urgently needed to address deficiencies in the availability and readiness to deliver surgical services in these nations, and this will require commitment from multiple stakeholders.

Serial assessment of trauma care capacity in Ghana in 2004 and 2014,"Stewart, B. T.; Quansah, R.; Gyedu, A.; Boakye, G.; Abantanga, F.; Ankomah, J.; Donkor, P.; Mock, C.","IMPORTANCE Trauma care capacity assessments in developing countries have generated evidence to support advocacy, detailed baseline capabilities, and informed targeted interventions. However, serial assessments to determine the effect of capacity improvements or changes over time have rarely been performed. OBJECTIVE To compare the availability of trauma care resources in Ghana between 2004 and 2014 to assess the effects of a decade of change in the trauma care landscape and derive recommendations for improvements. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Capacity assessmentswere performed using direct inspection and structured interviews derived from theWorld Health Organization's Guidelines for Essential Trauma Care. In Ghana, 10 hospitals in 2004 and 32 hospitals in 2014 were purposively sampled to represent those most likely to care for injuries. Clinical staff, administrators, logistic/procurement officers, and technicians/biomedical engineers who interacted, directly or indirectly, with trauma care resources were interviewed at each hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Availability of items for trauma carewas rated from 0 (complete absence) to 3 (fully available). Factors contributing to deficiency in 2014 were determined for items rated lower than 3. Each item rated lower than 3 at a specific hospital was defined as a hospital-item deficiency. Scores for total number of hospital-item deficiencies were derived for each contributing factor. RESULTS There were significant improvements in mean ratings for trauma care resources: district-level (smaller) hospitals had a mean rating of 0.8 for all items in 2004 vs 1.3 in 2014 (P =.002); regional (larger) hospitals had a mean rating of 1.1 in 2004 vs 1.4 in 2014 (P =.01). However, a number of critical deficiencies remain (eg, chest tubes, diagnostics, and orthopedic and neurosurgical care; mean ratings≤2). Leading contributing factors were item absence (503 hospital-item deficiencies), lack of training (335 hospital-item deficiencies), and stockout of consumables (137 hospital-item deficiencies). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE There has been significant improvement in trauma care capacity during the past decade in Ghana; however, critical deficiencies remain and require urgent redress to avert preventable death and disability. Serial capacity assessment is a valuable tool for monitoring efforts to strengthen trauma care systems, identifying what has been successful, and highlighting needs.",2016,NA,JAMA Surgery,151,2,164-171,NA,10.1001/jamasurg.2015.3648,19977,#8257,Stewart 2016,"Rachel Wangi (2025-02-13 02:48:15)(Select): Discusses access to surgical care and surgical capacity, including some reconstructive surgical conditions.;",Access to Healthcare; Barriers to Care; Trauma,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes

Identifying opportunities for global surgery in Cameroon: an analysis of existing health policies and events,"Takoutsing, B. D.; Endalle, G.; Senyuy, W. P.; Celestin, B. M.; Kwasseu, G. K.; Tanyi, P. B.; Jumbam, D. T.; Kanmounye, U. S.","INTRODUCTION: the burden of diseases amenable to surgery, obstetrics, trauma, and anesthesia (SOTA) care is increasing globally but low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected. The Lancet Commission on Global Surgery proposed National Surgical, Obstetrics, and Anesthesia Plans as national policies to reduce the global SOTA burden. These plans are dependent on comprehensive stakeholder engagement and health policy analysis. Objective: in this study, we analyzed existing national health policies and events in Cameroon to identify opportunities for SOTA policies. METHODS: we searched the Cameroonian Ministry of Health´s health policy database to identify past and current policies. Next, the policies were retrieved and screened for mentions of SOTA-related interventions using relevant keywords in French and English, and analyzed using the 'eight-fold path´ framework for public policy analysis. RESULTS: we identified 136 policies and events and excluded 16 duplicates. The health policies and events included were implemented between 1967 and 2021. Fifty-nine policies and events (49.2%) mentioned SOTA care: governance (n=25), infrastructure (n=21), service delivery (n=11), workforce (n=11), information management (n=10), and funding (n=8). Most policies and events focused on maternal and neonatal health, followed by anesthesia, ophthalmologic surgery, and trauma. National, multinational civil society organizations and private stakeholders supported these policies and events, and the Cameroonian Ministry of Public Health was the largest funder. CONCLUSION: most Cameroonian SOTA-related policies and events focus on maternal and neonatal care, and health financing is the health system component with the least policies and events.

"Understanding the Burden of Pediatric Traumatic Injury in Uganda: A Multicenter, Prospective Study","Thomas, H. S.; Emmanuel, A.; Kayima, P.; Ajiko, M. M.; Grabski, D. F.; Situma, M.; Kakembo, N.; Ozgediz, D. E.; Sabatini, C. S.","INTRODUCTION: Traumatic injury is responsible for eight million childhood deaths annually. In Uganda, there is a paucity of comprehensive data describing the burden of pediatric trauma, which is essential for resource allocation and surgical workforce planning. This study aimed to ascertain the burden of non-adolescent pediatric trauma across four Ugandan hospitals. METHODS: We performed a descriptive review of four independent and prospective pediatric surgical databases in Uganda: Mulago National Referral Hospital (2012-2019), Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (2015-2019), Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) (2016-2019), and St Mary's Hospital Lacor (SMHL) (2016-2019). We sub-selected all clinical encounters that involved trauma. The primary outcome was the distribution of injury mechanisms. Secondary outcomes included operative intervention and clinical outcomes. RESULTS: There was a total of 693 pediatric trauma patients, across four hospital sites: Mulago National Referral Hospital (n = 245), Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (n = 29), SRRH (n = 292), and SMHL (n = 127). The majority of patients were male (63%), with a median age of 5 [interquartile range = 2, 8]. Chiefly, patients suffered blunt injury mechanisms, including falls (16.2%) and road traffic crashes (14.7%) resulting in abdominal trauma (29.4%) and contusions (11.8%). At SRRH and SMHL, from which orthopedic data were available, 27% of patients suffered long-bone fractures. Overall, 55% of patients underwent surgery and 95% recovered to discharge. CONCLUSIONS: In Uganda, non-adolescent pediatric trauma patients most commonly suffer injuries due to falls and road traffic crashes, resulting in high rates of abdominal trauma. Amid surgical workforce deficits and resource-variability, these data support interventions aimed at training adult general surgeons to provide emergency pediatric surgical care and procedures.",2024,NA,J Surg Res,300,NA,467-476,38870654,10.1016/j.jss.2024.04.043,13382,#8543,Thomas 2024,NA,Barriers to Care; Burden; Children / Pediatric Population; Post-Traumatic Injuries,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Management of paediatric burns in low- and middle-income countries: assessing capacity using the World Health Organization Surgical Assessment Tool,"Thomson, I. K.; Iverson, K. R.; Innocent, S. H. S.; Kaseje, N.; Johnson, W. D.","Background: Burns are a leading cause of global disease burden, with children in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) disproportionately affected. Effective management improves outcomes; however, the availability of necessary resources in LMICs remains unclear. We evaluated surgical centres in LMICs using the WHO Surgical Assessment Tool (SAT) to identify opportunities to optimize paediatric burn care. Methods: We reviewed WHO SAT database entries for 2010-2015. A total of 1121 facilities from 57 countries met the inclusion criteria: facilities with surgical capacity in LMICs operating on children. Human resources, equipment and infrastructure relevant to paediatric burn care were analysed by WHO Regional and World Bank Income Classifications and facility type. Results: Facilities had an average of 147 beds and performed 485 paediatric operations annually. Discrepancies existed between procedures performed and resource availability; 86% of facilities performed acute burn care, but only 37% could consistently provide intravenous fluids. Many, particularly tertiary, centres performed contracture release and skin grafting (41%) and amputation (50%). Conclusions: LMICs have limited resources to provide paediatric burn care but widely perform many interventions necessary to address the burden of burns. The SAT may not capture innovative and traditional approaches to burn care. There remains an opportunity to improve paediatric burn care globally.",2020,NA,Int.

Survival after burn in a sub-Saharan burn unit: Challenges and opportunities,"Tyson, A. F.; Boschini, L. P.; Kiser, M. M.; Samuel, J. C.; Mjuweni, S. N.; Cairns, B. A.; Charles, A. G.","Background Burns are among the most devastating of all injuries and a major global public health crisis, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In developed countries, aggressive management of burns continues to lower overall mortality and increase lethal total body surface area (TBSA) at which 50% of patients die (LA50). However, lack of resources and inadequate infrastructure significantly impede such improvements in developing countries. Methods This study is a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to the burn center at Kamuzu Central Hospital in Lilongwe, Malawi between June 2011 and December 2012. We collected information including patient age, gender, date of admission, mechanism of injury, time to presentation to hospital, total body surface area (TBSA) burn, comorbidities, date and type of operative procedures, date of discharge, length of hospital stay, and survival. We then performed bivariate analysis and logistic regression to identify characteristics associated with increased mortality. Results A total of 454 patients were admitted during the study period with a median age of 4 years (range 0.5 months to 79 years). Of these patients, 53% were male. The overall mean TBSA was 18.5%, and average TBSA increased with age - 17% for 0-18 year olds, 24% for 19-60 year olds, and 41% for patients over 60 years old. Scald and flame burns were the commonest mechanisms, 52% and 41% respectively, and flame burns were associated with higher mortality. Overall survival in this population was 82%; however survival reduced with increasing age categories (84% in patients 0-18 years old, 79% in patients 19-60 years old, and 36% in patients older than 60 years). TBSA remained the strongest predictor of mortality after adjusting for age and mechanism of burn. The LA50 for this population was 39% TBSA. Discussion Our data reiterate that burn in Malawi is largely a pediatric disease and that the high burn mortality and relatively low LA50 have modestly improved over the past two decades. The lack of financial resources, health care personnel, and necessary infrastructure will continue to pose a significant challenge in this developing nation.

Delivery of operative pediatric surgical care by physicians and non-physician clinicians in Malawi,"Tyson, A. F.; Msiska, N.; Kiser, M.; Samuel, J. C.; McLean, S.; Varela, C.; Charles, A. G.","BACKGROUND: Specialized pediatric surgeons are unavailable in much of sub-Saharan Africa. Delegating some surgical tasks to non-physician clinical officers can mitigate the dependence of a health system on highly skilled clinicians for specific services. METHODS: We performed a case-control study examining pediatric surgical cases over a 12 month period. Operating surgeon was categorized as physician or clinical officer. Operative acuity, surgical subspecialty, and outcome were then compared between the two groups, using physicians as the control. RESULTS: A total of 1186 operations were performed on 1004 pediatric patients. Mean age was 6 years (±5) and 64% of patients were male. Clinical officers performed 40% of the cases. Most general surgery, urology and congenital cases were performed by physicians, while most ENT, neurosurgery, and burn surgery cases were performed by clinical officers. Reoperation rate was higher for patients treated by clinical officers (17%) compared to physicians (7.1%), although this was attributable to multiple burn surgical procedures. Physician and clinical officer cohorts had similar complication rates (4.5% and 4.0%, respectively) and mortality rates (2.5% and 2.1%, respectively). DISCUSSION: Fundamental changes in health policy in Africa are imperative as a significant increase in the number of surgeons available in the near future is unlikely. Task-shifting from surgeons to clinical officers may be useful to provide coverage of basic surgical care.",2014,NA,Int J Surg,12,5,509-15,24560846,10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.02.009,13450,#8707,Tyson 2014,NA,Surgical Capacity,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Implementation of a contextually appropriate pediatric emergency surgical care course in Uganda,"Ullrich, S.; Kisa, P.; Ruzgar, N.; Okello, I.; Oyania, F.; Kayima, P.; Kakembo, N.; Sekabira, J.; Situma, M.; Ozgediz, D.","Background: Low- and middle-income countries like Uganda face a severe shortage of pediatric surgeons. Most children with a surgical emergency are treated by nonspecialist rural providers. We describe the design and implementation of a locally driven, pilot pediatric emergency surgical care course to strengthen skills of these providers. This is the first description of such a course in the current literature. Methods: The course was delivered three times from 2018 to 2019. Modules include perioperative management, neonatal emergencies, intestinal emergencies, and trauma. A baseline needs assessment survey was administered. Participants in the second and third courses also took pre and postcourse knowledge-based tests. Results: Forty-five providers representing multiple cadres participated. Participants most commonly perform hernia/hydrocele repair (17% adjusted rating) in their current practice and are least comfortable managing cleft lip and palate (mean Likert score 1.4 ± 0.9). Equipment shortage was identified as the most significant challenge to delivering pediatric surgical care (24%). Scores on the knowledge tests improved significantly from pre- (55.4% ± 22.4%) to postcourse (71.9% ± 14.0%, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Nonspecialist clinicians are essential to the pediatric surgical workforce in LMICs. Short, targeted training courses can increase provider knowledge about the management of surgical emergencies. The course has spurred local surgical outreach initiatives.

A.; Grp, Pressco Study","Background Understanding the burden of diseases requiring surgical care at national levels is essential to advance universal health coverage. The PREvalence Study on Surgical COnditions (PRESSCO) 2020 is a cross-sectional household survey to estimate the prevalence of physical conditions needing surgical consultation, to investigate healthcare-seeking behavior, and to assess changes from before the West African Ebola epidemic. Methods This study (ISRCTN: 12353489) was built upon the Surgeons Overseas Surgical Needs Assessment (SOSAS) tool, including expansions. Seventy-five enumeration areas from 9671 nationwide clusters were sampled proportional to population size. In each cluster, 25 households were randomly assigned and visited. Need for surgical consultations was based on verbal responses and physical examination of selected household members. Results A total of 3,618 individuals from 1,854 households were surveyed. Compared to 2012, the prevalence of individuals reporting one or more relevant physical conditions was reduced from 25 to 6.2% (95% CI 5.4-7.0%) of the population. One-in-five conditions rendered respondents unemployed, disabled, or stigmatized. Adult males were predominantly prone to untreated surgical conditions (9.7 vs. 5.9% women; p < 0.001). Financial constraints were the predominant reason for not seeking care. Among those seeking professional health care, 86.7% underwent surgery. Conclusion PRESSCO 2020 is the first surgical needs household survey which compares against earlier study data. Despite the 2013-2016 Ebola outbreak, which profoundly disrupted the national healthcare system, a substantial reduction in reported surgical conditions was observed.

This article describes the care of >80 burn victims at a rural hospital in Kenya, Nakuru Provincial General Hospital, and provides lessons for care of a large number of burned patients in a resource-limited setting. METHODS: Data were obtained from retrospective review from hospital registers and patient files. RESULTS: Treatment was provided for 89 victims. Eighty-six (97%) were men; median age was 25 years (interquartile range [IQR], 19-32). Half of the patients (45) died, the majority (31, 69%) within the first week. The median total body surface area burned for those who died was 80% (IQR, 60-90%) compared with 28% (IQR, 15-43%) for those who survived (p < 0.001). Twenty patients were transfused a total of 73 units of blood including one patient who received 9 units. Eighty surgical interventions were performed on 31 patients and included 39 split-thickness skin grafts, 21 debridements, 7 escharotomies, 6 dressing changes, 4 contracture releases, and 3 finger amputations. Of the 44 survivors, 39 (89%) were discharged within 4 months of the event. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality after mass burn disasters is high in Africa.

Paediatric surgical conditions in Malawi - A cross-sectional nationwide household survey,"Varela, C.; Viste, A.; Young, S.; Groen, R. S.; Banza, L.; Nandi, B.; Mkandawire, N.; Moen, B. E.","Background Untreated surgical conditions may lead to lifelong disability in children. Treating children with surgical conditions may reduce long-term effects of morbidity and disability. Unfortunately, low- and middle-income countries have limited resources for paediatric surgical care. Malawi, for example, has very few paediatric surgeons. There are also significantly inadequate infrastructures and personnel to treat these children. In order to strengthen resources that could provide such services, we need to begin by quantifying the need. Aim To estimate the approximate prevalence of surgical conditions among children in Malawi, to describe the anatomical locations and diagnoses of the conditions and the presence of injuries. Methods A cross-sectional, nationwide survey of surgical needs was performed in 28 of 29 districts of Malawi. Villages, households and household members were randomly selected. A total of 1487 households were visited and 2960 persons were interviewed. This paper is a sub analysis of the children in the dataset. Information was obtained from 255 living children and inquiry from household respondents for the 255 children who had died in the past year. The interviews were conducted by medical students over a 60-day period, and the validated SOSAS tool was used for data collection. Results There were 67 out of 255 (26.3%) total children living with a surgical condition at the time of the study, with most of the conditions located in the extremities. Half of the children lived with problems due to injuries. Traffic accidents were the most common cause. Two-thirds of the children living with a surgical condition had some kind of disability, and one-third of them were grossly disabled. There were 255 total deceased children, with 34 who died from a surgical condition. The most prevalent causes of death were congenital anomalies of the abdomen, groin and genital region. Conclusion An extrapolation of the 26% of children found to be living with a surgical condition indicates that there could be 2 million children living with a condition that needs surgical consultation or treatment in Malawi. Congenital anomalies cause significant numbers of deaths among Malawian children. Children living with surgical conditions had disorders in their extremities, causing severe disability.

We sought to assess the prevalence of surgical disease and disability in the elderly population of Sierra Leone to guide future development strategies. METHODS: A cluster randomized, cross-sectional household survey was carried out countrywide in Sierra Leone from January 9th to February 3rd 2012. Using a standardized questionnaire, household member demographics, deaths occurring during the previous 12 months, and presence of any current surgical condition were elucidated. A retrospective analysis of individuals aged 50 and over was performed. RESULTS: The survey included 1,843 households with a total of 3,645 respondents. Of these, 13.6 % (496/3,645) were aged over 50 years. Of the elderly individuals in our sample, 301 (60.7 %) reported a current surgical condition.

Epidemiology of injured patients in rural Uganda: A prospective trauma registry's first 1000 days,"Zheng, D. J.; Sur, P. J.; Ariokot, M. G.; Juillard, C.; Ajiko, M. M.; Dicker, R. A.","Trauma is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Data characterizing the burden of injury in rural Uganda is limited. Hospital-based trauma registries are a critical tool in illustrating injury patterns and clinical outcomes. This study aims to characterize the traumatic injuries presenting to Soroti Regional Referral Hospital (SRRH) in order to identify opportunities for quality improvement and policy development. From October 2016 to July 2019, we prospectively captured data on injured patients using a locally designed, contextrelevant trauma registry instrument. Information regarding patient demographics, injury characteristics, clinical information, and treatment outcomes were recorded. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistical analyses were conducted. A total of 4109 injured patients were treated during the study period. Median age was 26 years and 63% were male. Students (33%) and peasant farmers (31%) were the most affected occupations. Falls (36%) and road traffic injuries (RTIs, 35%) were the leading causes of injury. Nearly two-thirds of RTIs were motorcycle-related and only 16% involved a pedestrian. Over half (53%) of all patients had a fracture or a sprain. Suffering a burn or a head injury were significant predictors of mortality. The number of trauma patients enrolled in the study declined by five-fold when comparing the final six months and initial six months of the study. Implementation of a context-appropriate trauma registry in a resource-constrained setting is feasible. In rural Uganda, there is a significant need for injury prevention efforts to protect vulnerable populations such as children and women from trauma on roads and in the home. Orthopedic and neurosurgical care are important targets for the strengthening of health systems. The comprehensive data provided by a trauma registry will continue to inform such efforts and provide a way to monitor their progress moving forward.",2021,NA,PLoS ONE,16,1 January,NA,NA,10.1371/journal.pone.0245779,17590,#9475,Zheng 2021,"Saidu Ahmad Idris (2025-01-17 08:07:50)(Select): burden: burns, gunshots and RTA ;",Barriers to Care; Burden; Trauma,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
"Prevalence of thoracic surgical care need in a developing country: results of a cluster-randomized, cross-sectional nationwide survey","Zogg, C. K.; Kamara, T. B.; Groen, R. S.; Mungo, B.; Kushner, A. L.; Molena, D.","BACKGROUND: Developing countries without established surgical capacity face heightened morbidity and mortality from poorly understood, untreated thoracic surgical impairments. This study sought to estimate the prevalence of thoracic surgical need in a low-income country and consider contributing factors involved. METHODS: Cluster-randomized, cross-sectional nationwide survey using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need tool in Sierra Leone from January 9-February 3, 2012. RESULTS: Data were collected and analyzed from 3645 respondents (response rate 98.3%). 273 (7.5%) reported ≥1 chest (including heart, lungs, and mediastinum) or breast surgical problem during their lifetime; 268 (7.4%) reported ≥1 back complaint. Multiple problems could be reported, resulting in a total of 277 chest/breast and 268 back complaints. The majority (184/545) were related to acquired deformities. Most occurred ≥12 months ago (364/545) and continued to impact the participant at the time of the interview (339/545). 322/545 sought care; however, 40% (130/322) did not receive care, predominately due to an inability to pay. Adjusted logistic regression found that chest/breast problems were more common among farm workers, older participants, and individuals with minimal education, while back problems were more common in the same groups and males. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides data on the prevalence of thoracic surgical conditions and factors affecting prevalence in one of the world's poorest countries. The results speak to the need for further work to enhance health systems strengthening while offering the opportunity for future training and research in resource-limited settings--an area of thoracic surgery that is not well understood.",2015,NA,Int J Surg,13,NA,1-7,25447608,10.1016/j.ijsu.2014.11.026,14220,#9493,Zogg 2015,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-17 22:58:11)(Select): burns, deformities, barriers (40% did not receive care due to an inability to pay); Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-17 20:53:15)(Select): Perhaps this specific study could be useful in terms of identifying burden?

"DEVELOPING A BURN UNIT: OUR EXPERIENCE AT ALEX EKWUEME FEDERAL UNIVERSITY TEACHING HOSPITAL ABAKALIKI, SOUTHEAST NIGERIA","Chidiebele, Charles; Mbbs, Maduba; Uzodimma, Ugochukwu; Mbbs, Nnadozie; Mmaduwuike, Gabriel; Mbbs, Okorie; Ifeanyichukwu, Edwin; Mbbs, Enyanwuma",Background: The burden of burn injuries in developing countries overwhelms the few regional burn centers. Tertiary institutions are involved hugely in the management of extensive burn injuries despite the lack of specialized burn units. This necessitates setting up a burn unit in our tertiary center. We aim to share our experience to stimulate our colleagues in different tertiary institutions to commence the process of setting up a Burn Unit in their respective institutions. Methods and Results: The development of the Burn unit in Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital Abakaliki took approximately 7.5 years from September 2013 to March 2021. It started as a Burn Facility and smoothly developed into a Burn Unit with a distinct leadership and resulted in a more effective and smooth running of the unit with an improved capacity and a promising outcome. Conclusion: A strong commitment is required from the plastic surgeons to drive the process of setting up a Burn Unit through a rigorous transition from a burn facility smoothened by the ability to make a case for expansion of an existing unit. The argument is to ensure that Burn Unit takes its rightful place like Emergency and In-,2022,NA,Ethiop Med J,60,NA,185-188,NA,NA,11470,#9524,Chidiebele 2022,Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-01-30 01:25:50)(Select): surgical capacity (burns);,NA,NA,Access & Barriers,Yes
Surgical Reconstruction of Northern Uganda War Victims,"E.W. Kalanzi, R. Ssentongo R. Alenyo R. Zeeman","Background: Aid groups estimate that since 1086 when the war conflicts in Northern Uganda started, over 30,000 people have died in the insurgency and over 20,000 people have remained maimed. Arising from the conflict, innocent civilians have had their limbs, lips, eyes, ears, noses, breasts, fingers and toes cut off. Patients and Methods: Between 2004 and 2005, a total of 34 victims of the Northern Uganda war, underwent reconstructive surgery. Most of the patients were treated from the local hospitals of Lira, Gulu and Kitgum. Results: Between 2004 and 2006, the Plastic Surgery team of Mulago hospital rehabilitated 34 victims of the northern war. Of these 23 were females and 11 were males. Most of these people had suffered severe disfigurements which necessitated multiple staged reconstructive procedures on them. The majority of the reconstructive operations were on the lips despite the fact that many victims had also suffered from mutilation of other body parts. Conclusion: Effects of the insurgency on individuals, families and communities included: Increased burden on health care delivery Hospital capacity overwhelmed with few doctors and nurses available Increased number of traumatised people Increased number of war causalities Population maimed with body parts cut off Increased dependency of local population on hand outs from government and relief agencies.

Burns and Scalds - Epidemiology and Prevention in a Developing Country,"Olaitan, P. B.; Olaitan, J. O.","Background: Burns and scalds are common presentation to many of our health institutions. Most of these injuries are preventable. Many of the patients however end with severe morbidity or even death. People affected are mostly of poor socioeconomic status. The cost of managing these injuries is high. Coupled with this are poor facilities in most parts of the developing countries like Nigeria and insufficient personnel to take care of this group of people. Study of the epidemiology as well as suggestions on preventive measures are therefore overdue and hence this publication. Methods: A review of the literature on this subject with emphasis on Nigeria was done bearing in mind the epidemiology and prevention of bum. Literature search was done using the medline as well as local journals. Results: Causes of burn injuries are many in the developing countries. Most of these are however preventable. Some preventive measures have been suggested by workers in this part of the world. Some measures that have worked in reducing burn injuries in some advanced countries and that may be appropriate to our situation are noted and are also suggested in this paper. Conclusion: Prevention of burn injuries, based on the epidemiology of burn in developing countries, remains a major way of reducing the current spate of morbidity and mortality in our patients.",2005,NA,Nigerian Journal of Medicine,14,1,9-9,NA,NA,11474,#9537,Olaitan 2005,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-17 22:21:13)(Select): Burden of burdens,;",NA,NA,Access & Barriers,Yes
Team approach to management of oro‑facial cleft among African practitioners: A survey,"Vi Akinmoladun, O. S. Obimakinde V. N. Okoje","Background: An interdisciplinary team approach concept has been proposed for management of oro‑facial cleft in the last two decades. Our objective was to evaluate the practice of the team approach concept and practices of the specialists involved in oro‑facial cleft care in Africa. Materials and Methods: A snapshot survey was conducted among the attendees of the 2nd Pan‑African Congress on Cleft Lip and Palate, at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Nigeria, in February 2007. Result: Of the 120 questionnaires distributed, 91 were returned for analysis (75.8% response rate). Mean age of respondents was 43.6 ± 4.97 years and the range was 36‑62 years. Male‑to‑female ratio was 3.5:1. Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and Plastic Surgeons constituted the majority of respondents (34.1% and 29.7% respectively). Only 48.4% (44 respondents) of the specialists belonged to cleft teams. Majority of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons and Plastic Surgeons belonged to cleft teams (65.9 and 79.5% respectively), while Speech Pathologists and Orthodontists were less represented (18.2% and 40.9% respectively). Conclusion: Findings from this study have shown that interdisciplinary care for the cleft patient is not yet fully established in Africa. The result obtained also suggests that cleft care in African population is young, and team care is perhaps many years behind the global trend. This may be a result of several reasons ranging from lack of sufficient specialists in African population generally to the relatively young age of cleft care practice in that part of the world",2013,NA,Nigerian Journal of Clinical Practice,16,1,5,NA,10.4103/1119-3077.106773,11548,#9543,ViAkinmoladun 2013,NA,Cleft Palate; Surgical Capacity,Access & Barriers,Congenital Malformations,Yes
Challenges Facing Surgical Training in the Great Lakes Region in Sub-Saharan Africa: a Review Article,"Galukande, M.; Luboga, S.; Elobu, E.","Background: There is a severe shortage of health workers in sub-Saharan Africa yet this subcontinent experiences a significant proportion of the world’s disease burden. This shortage is further reflected in the lack of personnel for surgical sub specialities such as orthopaedics, paediatrics, neurology and urology to mention but a few. Objective: This review therefore sought to summarize the current literature on the state of surgical training in sub Saharan Africa, discuss the challenges faced and the possible ways to overcome these challenges Methods: We performed online searches of electronic databases i.e. PUBMED, MEDLINE and African Journals online that feature many African Journals not index by the ‘regular’ databases. Results: The searches returned 88 articles and 24 of which were included in the review, we present results focused on; training capacity and methods, scope of practice, technology and surgery, and low research capacity and output. Conclusion: The future of surgical training in Africa will depend on the ability of the leadership to create or and adopt innovative educational technologies, recruit and retain trainers and attract trainees on one hand and on the other, the growth of demand for quality surgical care in the great lakes regions. For those that have excelled in training need to build on those successes and share their stories.",2013,NA,East and Central African Journal of Surgery,18,3,9,NA,NA,11528,#9554,Galukande 2013,NA,Barriers to Care; Surgical Capacity,Access & Barriers,Burden & Outcome,Yes
Barriers to timely surgery and early surgical outcomes for breast cancer patients in a setting with limited resources,"Ntirenganya, F.; Hirwa, A.; Banguti, P.; Ainhoa, C. C.; Rulisa, S.","BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patients in Rwanda are young, premenopausal and presenting with advanced stages. Surgery is often the primary line of treatment and its timing may impact adjuvant medical and/or radiation therapies, influencing negative outcomes. The objective of this study was to identify barriers to timely surgery and describe early surgical outcomes for patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer at two tertiary hospitals in Rwanda. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Teaching Hospital of Kigali and Rwanda Military Hospital over 12 a month period from May 2016 to May 2017. RESULTS: 69 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age was 48 years. 74.16% of patients ≤ 60 years, 58% were premenopausal. 69.5% presented with locally advanced stages. Mean duration of symptoms was 10.9 months before initial consultation. Patients had to wait 91 days (3 months) before surgery. Mean hospital stay was 5 days after surgery and 98.9% underwent modified radical mastectomy. No major complications reported. Socio-economic status(p=0.0002), level of education (p=0.000), traditional healer’s consultation (p=0.0001) influenced the timing of the initial consultation. Level of first heath facility consulted (P=0.00045), number of breast surgeon (p=0.0000), pathology report availability, (p=0.0004) and imaging availability (p=:0.0006) influenced timing of surgery. CONCLUSION: Delays to surgery are both patient and system-related. Increased awareness, surgical outreaches and task sharing with a non-breast surgical specialist may decrease delays to surgery and increase timely access to subsequent adjuvant therapies. Even if early surgical outcomes are good, long term follow up study is necessary to assess oncological outcomes.",2019,NA,Rwanda Medical Journal,76,4,5,NA,NA,11532,#9563,Ntirenganya 2019,Rachel Wangi (2025-01-31 01:50:39)(Select): Barriers to care;,NA,NA,Access & Barriers,Yes
Untreated surgical conditions in Malawi: A randomised cross-sectional nationwide household survey,"Varela, Carlos; Young, Sven; Groen, Reinou; Banza, Leonard; Mkandawire, Nyengo C.; Viste, Asgaut","Background Noncommunicable diseases, such as surgical conditions have received little attention from public health planners in low income countries (LIC) like Malawi. Though increasingly recognised as a growing global health problem, the burden of surgical pathologies and access to surgical care has not been adequately identified in many LIC. Information on the spectrum and burden of surgical disease in Malawi is important to uncover the unmet need for surgery and for planning of the National Health Service. Methods This was a multistage random cluster sampling national survey. Households were selected from clusters using probability proportional to size method. 1448 households and 2909 interviewees were analysed. The Surgeons Overseas Assessment of Surgical need (SOSAS) tool was used to collect data. This electronic tablet based questionnaire tool included general information and a dual personalised head to toe inquiry on surgical conditions. The general information included number of household members, and inquired on any death within the past twelve months, and if any of the deaths in the family had a suspected surgical condition leading to that death. Data was collected by specially trained third year medical students. Results Out of 1480 selected households, 1448 (98%) agreed to participate, with 2909 interviewed individuals included in the study. The median household size was 6 individuals (range 1 - 47). Median age of interviewed persons was 35 years (range 0.25 - 104 years). 1027 out of 2909 (35%) of the interviewed people reported to be living with a condition requiring surgical consultation or intervention, whereas 146 of 616 (24%) of the total deaths reported to have occurred in the preceding 12 months were reported to have died from a surgically related condition. Most individuals did not seek health care due to lack of funds for transportation to the health facility. Only 3.1% of those that reported a surgical condition had surgical intervention. Conclusions There is a large unmet need for surgical care in Malawi. A third of the population is living with a condition needing surgical consultation or intervention, and a quarter of all deaths are potentially avoidable with surgery. Urgent scale up of surgical services and training are needed to reduce this huge gap in public health planning in the country.",2017,NA,Malawi Medical Journal,29,3,231-236,NA,10.4314/mmj.v29i3.1,11519,#9571,Varela 2017,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-31 01:48:37)(Select): .
