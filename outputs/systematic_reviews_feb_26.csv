Surgical burn care in sub-saharan africa: A systematic review,"Beijneveld, J. A.; Botman, M.; Hendriks, T. C. C.; Negenborn, V. L.; Schoonmade, L. J.; Mackie, D. P.; Van Zuijlen, P. P. M.","Burn injuries are still one of the most common and devastating global health problems worldwide. The vast majority of burns occur in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A certain standard of surgical and anesthesia care is essential to minimize morbidity and mortality. The aim of this study is to obtain baseline information on surgical burn care in SSA and to determine how this can be improved. A systematic review (PRISMA) was conducted. Data were extracted regarding patient characteristics, surgical care, dressing techniques and outcome. Forty-seven articles from 12 different countries were included. The mean TBSA was 18.2%. Overall mortality was 12.6%. Of the included patients, 47% underwent an operation. Seventeen studies (36% of included studies) reported on the number of patients with deep burn wounds in their population. In this group, 90% was grafted (reported in 17 studies), 25% was done early (<10 days), and 75% late. In this group, the escharotomy rate was 11% (only shown in 3 studies), the amputation rate was 3% (in 6 studies), and development of contractures 8% (reported in 6 studies). Research on surgical burn care in SSA is scarce and a wide range of surgical treatment strategies was found. We were unable to conclude which treatment protocol, early or delayed excision, was most effective. Future studies should ensure uniform data collection to enable comparison between treatment strategies. To improve burn care, the recently published ISBI guidelines for burns provide a practical tool and national and regional treatment protocols, including training in burn surgery, should be developed. We recommend a new review of surgical care in 5 years to evaluate the effects of the ISBI guidelines.",2018,NA,Wound Repair and Regeneration,26,2,A18,NA,NA,19104,#1290,Beijneveld 2018,NA,Burden; Burns,"Burden & Outcome, Trauma","Burden & Outcome, Trauma, Systematic Review",Yes
"Prevalence of pressure ulcers and associated factors among adult patients admitted at Comprehensive Specialized Hospital, Northwest Ethiopia, 2023","Beriso, H. B.; Zemene, W.; Tesfaye, E.","Pressure ulcers are a serious concern in patients with prolonged bedtime and present with common complications following surgery. It is one of the key performance indicators of the quality of nursing care provided to patients. Several studies have reported the prevalence of pressure ulcers in Ethiopia, but the current study area has not yet been fully addressed. Hence, the study aims to assess pressure ulcers and their associated factors among adult patients admitted to the surgical ward. An institution-based, cross-sectional study was conducted from April 15 to May 15, 2023. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select 480 patients. A standardized, pre-tested, and structured questionnaire was used. The results were presented descriptively using tables and figures. A binary logistic regression was used to assess associated factors. From a total of 480, all patients have participated with a 100% response rate. The prevalence rate of pressure ulcers was 10.2%. Being smoker [95% CI AOR 7.46 (2.64, 21.06)], bedridden [95% CI AOR 3.92 (1.28, 11.66)], having a length of hospital stay of greater than 20 days [95% CI AOR 3.01 (1.13, 8.02)], experiencing pain [95% CI AOR 3.20 (1.06, 7.51)], or having friction and shear [95% CI AOR 5.71 (1.91, 17.08)], were significantly associated with pressure ulcers. This study showed that a considerable proportion of patients had pressure ulcers. Smoking, having pain, being bedridden, being exposed to friction and shear problems, and length of hospital stay were significantly associated with pressure ulcers. Healthcare providers should educate patients about smoking risks, pain management, mattress installation, and linen care.",2024,NA,Scientific reports,14,1,17290,NA,10.1038/s41598-024-67026-5,15510,#1365,Beriso 2024,"Rachel Wangi (2025-01-19 23:49:16)(Select): Burden; Rachel Wangi (2025-01-19 23:47:54)(Select): Pressure ulcers can be considered reconstructive surgical conditions, especially in severe cases where they require surgical intervention.;",NA,NA,"Burden & Outcome, Trauma, Systematic Review",Yes
A Systematic Review of the Cost-Effectiveness of Cleft Care in Low- and Middle-Income Countries: What is Needed?,"Chung, K. Y.; Ho, G.; Erman, A.; Bielecki, J. M.; Forrest, C. R.; Sander, B.","Objective: The objective of this paper is to conduct a systematic review that summarizes the cost-effectiveness of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) care in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) based on existing literature. Design: We searched eleven electronic databases for articles from January 1, 2000 to December 29, 2020. This study is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020148402). Two reviewers independently conducted primary and secondary screening, and data extraction. Setting: All CL/P cost-effectiveness analyses in LMIC settings. Patients, Participants: In total, 2883 citations were screened. Eleven articles encompassing 1,001,675 patients from 86 LMICs were included. Main Outcome Measures: We used cost-effectiveness thresholds of 1% to 51% of a country's gross domestic product per capita (GDP/capita), a conservative threshold recommended for LMICs. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. Results: Primary CL/P repair was cost-effective at the threshold of 51% of a country's GDP/capita across all studies. However, only 1 study met at least 70% of the JBI criteria. There is a need for context-specific cost and health outcome data for primary CL/P repair, complications, and existing multidisciplinary management in LMICs. Conclusions: Existing economic evaluations suggest primary CL/P repair is cost-effective, however context-specific local data will make future cost-effectiveness analyses more relevant to local decision-makers and lead to better-informed resource allocation decisions in LMICs.",2023,NA,Cleft Palate Craniofacial Journal,60,12,1600-1608,NA,10.1177/10556656221111028,15815,#1993,Chung 2023,NA,Cleft Palate; Congenital Malformations; Cost,"Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations","Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations, Systematic Review",Yes
Prioritisation of Surgery in the National Health Strategic Plans of Africa: A Systematic Review,"Citron, I.; Chokotho, L.; Lavy, C.","INTRODUCTION: Disease amenable to surgical intervention accounts for 11-15 % of world disability and there is increasing interest in surgery as a global public health issue. National Health Strategic Plans (NHSPs) reflect countries' long-term health priorities, plans and targets. These plans were analysed to assess the prioritisation of surgery as a public health issue in Africa. METHODS: NHSPs of 43 independent Sub-Saharan African countries available in the public domain in March 2014 in French or English were searched electronically for key terms: surg*, ortho*, trauma, cancer, appendic*, laparotomy, HIV, tuberculosis, malaria. They were then searched manually for disease prevalence, targets, and human resources. RESULTS: 19 % of NHSPs had no mention of surgery or surgical conditions. 63 % had five or less mentions of surgery. HIV and malaria had 3772 mentions across all the policies, compared to surgery with only 376 mentions. Trauma had 239 mentions, while the common surgical conditions of appendicitis, laparotomy and hernia had no mentions at all. Over 95 % of NHSPs specifically mentioned the prevalence of HIV, tuberculosis, malaria, infant mortality and maternal mortality. Whereas, the most commonly mentioned surgical condition for which a prevalence was given was trauma, in only 47 % of policies. All NHSPs had plans and measurable targets for the reduction of HIV and tuberculosis. Of the total 4064 health targets, only 2 % were related to surgical conditions or surgical care. 33 % of policies had no surgical targets. DISCUSSION: NHSPs are the best available measure of health service and planning priorities. It is clear from our findings that surgery is poorly represented and that surgical conditions and surgical treatment are not widely recognised as a public health priority. Greater prioritisation of surgery in national health strategic policies is required to build resilient surgical systems.",2016,NA,World J Surg,40,4,779-83,26711637,10.1007/s00268-015-3333-9,14755,#2011,Citron 2016,"Camille Beatrice Valera (2025-02-13 04:49:48)(Select): general surgical capacity / barriers to care

African primary research publications in plastic surgery: A PRISMA-S-compliant systematic review,"Dje Bi Dje-Assi, V.; Amouzou, K. S.; Kouevi-Koko, T. E.; Jalloh, A.","Background: Plastic surgery (PS) in Africa is a relatively young surgery specialty, and the number of available plastic surgeons on average is one or two surgeons per country in many African low-income countries. This systematic review aims to geographically map the research activities through scientific publications of African PS centres, between February 2012-February 2023. Methods: We searched four literature databases (Medline, Embase, Google Scholar and African Journal Online) and did a manual search. We included case reports, randomised controlled trials, and clinical, comparative, observational and multicentre studies conducted in Africa and published in English and French. In the Google Scholar database, we analysed the first 200 references (scientific articles) selected per relevance according to the Boolean terms. In the African Journals Online database, we analysed the references from the first five pages. The selected keywords were: burns, trauma reconstruction, pressure injuries, wound, cleft lip and palate, breast reconstruction, microsurgery, aesthetic surgery, face surgery, head and neck surgery, hand surgery, open fracture surgery, oculoplastic surgery, skin surgery, and soft tissue surgery. Results: We retrieved a total of 228 articles. Out of the 73 African centres we identified, 27 were in the North, 22 in the West, 8 in the East, 3 in the Centre, and 14 in the South. Most of the retrieved 228 articles involved burns (60, 26.31%), congenital abnormalities (52, 22.80%) and reconstruction (28,12.80%); however, other conditions, such as breast or skin cancer, hand surgery, microsurgery or aesthetics are emerging. The studies were case reports/case series (93, 40.78%), retrospective (78, 34.21%), prospective (36, 15.78%), randomised controlled studies (10, 4.38%), cross-sectional (5, 2,19%) and cohort (2, 0.87%).

Systematic review of met and unmet need of surgical disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa,"Grimes, C. E.; Law, R. S.; Borgstein, E. S.; Mkandawire, N. C.; Lavy, C. B.","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the burden of surgical disease in rural sub-Saharan Africa, where district and rural hospitals are the main providers of care. The present study sought to analyze what is known about the met and unmet need of surgical disease. METHODS: The PubMed and EMBASE databases were searched for studies of surveys in rural areas, information on surgical admissions, and operations performed within rural and district hospitals. Data were extrapolated to calculate the amount of surgical disease per 100,000 population and the number of operations performed per 100,000 population. These extrapolations were used to estimate the total, the met, and the unmet need of surgical disease. RESULTS: The estimated overall incidence of nonfatal injury is at least 1,690/100,000 population per year. Morbidity as a result of injury is up to 190/100,000 population per year, and the annual mortality from injury is 53-92/100,000. District hospitals perform 6 fracture reductions (95% CI: 0.1-12)/100,000 population per year and 14 laparotomies (95% CI: 7-21)/100,000 per year. The incidence of peritonitis and bowel obstruction is unknown, although it may be as high as 1,364/100,000 population for the acute abdomen. The annual total need for inguinal hernia repair is estimated to be a minimum of 205/100,000 population. The average district hospital performs 30 hernia repairs (95% CI: 18-41)/100,000 population per year, leaving an unmet need of 175/100,000 population annually. CONCLUSIONS: District hospitals are not meeting the surgical needs of the populations they serve.

Global Prevalence and Burden of Orofacial Clefts: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019,"Kantar, R. S.; Hamdan, U. S.; Muller, J. N.; Hemal, K.; Younan, R. A.; Haddad, M.; Melhem, A. M.; Griot, Jpwd; Breugem, C. C.; Mokdad, A. H.","Orofacial clefts, in particular cleft lip and cleft palate, are among the most common congenital anomalies. Despite guidelines recommending early surgical correction, a global backlog of untreated patients persists. This has made orofacial clefts an attractive target for global cleft care initiatives. The most recent global burden of orofacial clefts was estimated to be 529,758.92 disability-adjusted life years (95% uncertainty interval: 362,492.88-798,419.69 disability-adjusted life years), whereas the global prevalence of orofacial clefts was estimated to be 4.6 million (95% uncertainty interval: 3.8-5.7 million). An inverse relationship exists between the Sociodemographic Index and the burden of orofacial clefts. Sub-Saharan Africa, Middle East/North Africa, and South Asia are the regions carrying the most significant burden of orofacial clefts.

Pediatric burn contractures in low- and lower middle-income countries: A systematic review of causes and factors affecting outcome,"Meng, F.; Zuo, K. J.; Amar-Zifkin, A.; Baird, R.; Cugno, S.; Poenaru, D.","In low- and lower middle-income countries (LMICs), timely access to primary care following thermal injury is challenging. Children with deep burns often fail to receive specialized burn care until months or years post-injury, thus suffering impairments from hypertrophic scarring or joint and soft tissue contractures. We aimed to examine the correlation between limited access to care following burn injury and long-term disability in children in LMICs and to identify specific factors affecting the occurrence of late burn complications. A systematic literature search was conducted to retrieve articles on pediatric burns in LMICs using Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, Global Health, African Index Medicus, and others. Articles were assessed by two reviewers and reported in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Of 2896 articles initially identified, 103 underwent full-text review and 14 met inclusion criteria. A total of 991 children who developed long-term burn sequelae were included. Time from injury to consultation ranged from a few months to 17 years.

Economic and Social Costs of Noma: Design and Application of an Estimation Model to Niger and Burkina Faso,"Mpinga, E. K.; Srour, M. L.; Moussa, M. A.; Dupuis, M.; Kagoné, M.; Grema, M. S. M.; Zacharie, N. B.; Baratti-Mayer, D.","BACKGROUND: While noma affects hundreds of thousands of children every year, taking their lives, disfiguring them and leaving them permanently disabled, the economic and social costs of the disease have not been previously estimated. An understanding of the nature and levels of these costs is much needed to formulate and implement strategies for the prevention and control of this disease, or to mitigate its burden. The objectives of our study were to develop a model for estimating the economic and social costs of noma and to provide estimates by applying this model to the specific contexts of two countries in the ""noma belt"", namely Burkina Faso and Niger. METHODS: Three main approaches were used. The estimation of prevalence levels of potential noma cases and of cases that should receive and actually do receive medical care was carried out using a literature review. The documentary approach made it possible to estimate the direct costs of noma by analyzing the database of a non-governmental organization operating in this field and present in both countries. Indirect costs were estimated using the human capital method and the cost component analysis technique. RESULTS: The direct costs of care and management of noma survivors amount to approximately USD 30 million per year in Burkina Faso, compared to approximately USD 31 million in Niger. They mainly include costs for medical treatment, surgery, hospital stays, physiological care, psychological care, social assistance, schooling, vocational training and care abroad. Indirect costs are estimated at around 20 million in lost production costs in Burkina and around 16 million in Niger. Costs related to premature deaths are estimated at more than USD 3.5 billion in Burkina Faso and USD 3 billion in Niger. Finally, the costs to survivors who are unable to marry are around USD 13.4 million in Burkina and around USD 15 million in Niger. Intangible costs were not calculated. CONCLUSIONS: The neglect of noma and inaction in terms of prevention and control of the disease have enormous economic and social costs for households, communities and states. Future studies of this kind are necessary and useful to raise awareness and eradicate this disease, which impacts the health and well-being of children and results in lifelong suffering and severe economic and social costs to survivors and their families.",2022,NA,Trop Med Infect Dis,7,7,NA,35878131,10.3390/tropicalmed7070119,15072,#5864,Mpinga 2022,NA,Cost; Noma,"Access & Barriers, Infectious & Chronic Conditions","Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Systematic Review",Yes
A plastic and reconstructive surgery landscape assessment of Malawi: a scoping review of Malawian literature,"Msokera, C.; Xepoleas, M.; Collier, Z. J.; Naidu, P.; Magee, W., 3rd","BACKGROUND: Plastic and reconstructive surgery (PRS) remains highly relevant to the unmet need for surgery in Malawi. Better understanding the current PRS landscape and its barriers may help address some of these challenges. This scoping review aimed to describe: (1) the scope and focus of the PRS literature being produced in Malawi and (2) the challenges, deficits, and barriers to providing accessible, high-quality PRS in Malawi. METHODS: This scoping review was conducted on four databases (SCOPUS, PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE) from inception through September 1, 2020 following the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. RESULTS: The database search retrieved 3852 articles, of which 31 were included that examined the burden of PRS-related conditions in Malawi. Of these 31 articles, 25 primarily discussed burn-related care. Burns injuries have a high mortality rate; between 27 and 75% in the studies. The literature revealed that there are only two burn units nationally with one PRS specialist in each unit, compounded by a lack of interest in PRS specialization by Malawian medical students. Congenital anomalies were the only other PRS-related condition examined and reported in the literature, accounting for 23% of all pediatric surgeries in tertiary facilities. CONCLUSIONS: There is a need to increase the country's capacity to handle burn reconstruction and other PRS-related conditions to reduce overall morbidity and mortality. Additional publicly funded research at the district and community level is warranted to determine the true burden of PRS disease in Malawi to derive health system strengthening and workforce capacity building strategies.",2022,NA,Eur J Med Res,27,1,119,35820981,10.1186/s40001-022-00714-y,13301,#5873,Msokera 2022,NA,Burden,Burden & Outcome,"Burden & Outcome, Access & Barriers, Congenital Malformations, Trauma, Systematic Review",Yes
"Cleft deformities in Zimbabwe, Africa: socioeconomic factors, epidemiology, and surgical reconstruction","Pham, A. M.; Tollefson, T. T.","In the African country of Zimbabwe, a variety of socioeconomic factors have contributed to a lack of specialty care and resources for the indigent population. Although cleft lip and palate has a lower incidence in Africa (0.67 per 1000 births) than in Latin America or Asia, access to reconstructive surgery is often difficult to obtain. A surgical team worked with Zimbabweans at the Harare Central Hospital, Harare, to perform cleft surgery for 39 patients. We review the epidemiology of cleft deformities in Africa, our experience with 39 patients with cleft lip and palate, and the techniques used to address 2 patients with midfacial clefts. To our knowledge, this retrospective case review and epidemiologic literature review is the first review of cleft care in Zimbabwe. Poverty in Zimbabwe, caused in part by the highest inflation rate in the world, has contributed to the emigration of a large number of specialists to other countries. In addition, the health care system is overwhelmed by a high prevalence rate of human immunodeficiency virus (25%), leading to a drastically reduced parental life expectancy (mean life expectancy, 36 years). Primary and secondary cleft lip and palate repairs were completed without complications. Children requiring care beyond the scope of this mission were referred to the Republic of South Africa. The cooperation among the Zimbabwean administration, physicians, and nurses was integral to the organization and successful execution of this reconstructive surgical mission.

"Characteristics, prevalence, and outcomes of diabetic foot ulcers in Africa. A systemic review and meta-analysis","Rigato, M.; Pizzol, D.; Tiago, A.; Putoto, G.; Avogaro, A.; Fadini, G. P.","Background: Among non-communicable diseases, diabetes represents a growing public health problem in Africa, where diabetes-related needs remain mostly unmet and the disabling features of foot are worsened by hygienic, cultural, and healthcare issues. We aimed to review clinical characteristics, prevalence, and outcomes of patients with diabetic foot ulcer in Africa. Methods: We searched the literature for cross-sectional and longitudinal studies reporting the characteristics of patients with diabetic foot in African countries, with a particular focus on ulcer prevalence, amputation rate, and mortality. Findings: Fifty-five full-text papers and ten abstracts were retrieved, reporting data from 19 African countries on 56,173 diabetic patients. According to the data collected, the overall prevalence of foot ulcers was 13% and increased over time, especially since 2001. Approximately 15% of patients with foot lesions underwent major amputation and 14.2% died during hospitalization. In patients with diabetic ulcers, insulin therapy was uncommon and neuropathy was the most common predisposing factor, but the prevalence of peripheral arterial disease correlated with amputation rates. Amputation and mortality decreased over time, probably as result of the implementation of screening programs in the last ten years. Mortality was directly related to previous amputation.
