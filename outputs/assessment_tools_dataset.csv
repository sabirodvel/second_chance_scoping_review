affordable, and effective surgical care. Pervasive workforce shortages and workforce maldistribution, high medical and non-medical costs of seeking care and lack of financial risk protection, and poor coordination of care are challenges of unique importance in these sectors. In addition to financial resources and infrastructure development, SOA workforce scale-up is highlighted as an urgent need. Historically, little attention has been paid to understanding and improving the capacity of the private and PNFP sector which must be a critical component of ongoing capacity building efforts going forward. Critical policy and programmatic developments are essential to coordinate and strengthen Ugandan surgical capacity""","PNFP hospitals often serve as referral centers when public hospitals are overwhelmed
